There's no info yet about whether VW intends to accept the offer or further negotiate the deal.\n\nQuantum Group is a holding company based in Zurich, Switzerland, and it might have a tangential relationship with the Porsche family.Rea Stark is representing Quantum in the Lamborghini purchase offer. He is also a co-founder of PiëchAutomotive along with Anton Piëch who is the son of former VW Group boss Ferdinand Piëch and the great-grandson of Ferdinand Porsche. Although, it's not clear if Anton Piëch has any role in this attempt to buy Lamborghini, according to Autocar.\n\nQuantum Group wants to purchase more than just the Lamborghini name. The deal would include buying the entire facility inSant’Agata, Italy, and the firm's motorsport operations. There would also be a five-year supplier agreement with Audi, which likely would allow Lambo to continue to produce the current models while preparing new ones. Quantum wants to shape the brand to \"spearhead for innovation by consistently implementing new clean drivetrain technologies,\" according to a document obtained by Autocar.\n\nThere have been rumors for years about VW Group selling Lamborghini. However, in late 2020, the automaker's supervisory board voted not to sell Lambo, Bentley, and Ducati. The company was doing an internal examination to see if the resources were available to develop EVs and autonomous technology while also investing in these premium marques.\"Brands must be measured against new requirements,\" VW Group Chief Executive Herbert Diess said at the time."

        "content": "certain parts of town. I had just dropped off a customer in Fairfield and was heading back toward downtown. I booked into the 200 zone as I approached the Arkadelphia Road exit. I immediately recieved a call to an address I knew to be in the Elyton project.\n\nThe cell phone seemed to be a permanant attachment to her body. She didn’t take it down from her ear until we had reached our destination. She was young, I’d say about 20. She was thin and dressed cheaply, a red bandana covered her hair. She quickly told me where she wanted to go, a payday/title loan place on Greensprings Highway. She was talking with someone who was obviously selling her something. I overheard talk of shipping options, dates of arrival ect…Whatever it was, I guess she really wanted it. So much so that she would call a cab to take her to get a loan to buy a money order in order to buy it, whatever it was.\n\nShe didn’t stay in the place very long, she was turned down quickly. It seems the only payday she had was a government check for a little more than two hundred dollars a month. She had no car to pawn the title to, she was S.O.L and so was I. She already owed me more than $20 by this time. Once it became clear that she had no means of paying the fare I just turned the meter off and told her I would take her home but let her know in no uncertain terms that I didn’t have to. I could have, and probably should have, just left her ass stranded there.\n\nI gave her a lecture on the way home about why she should make sure she had money before she called a cab. I told her that I could have called the cops and that most drivers would have called them. “Fo’ real?” she asked. “Fo’ what?” She had no idea that stiffing a cab driver could possibly be against the law. I told her it was called theft of service, which is similar to theft of property, like shoplifting from a store.”Naw it ain’t” she said. It seemed to me that this young woman had grown to adulthood without a clue as to how to function in society. Pitiful, I thought. At least she did offer a “thank you” as she got out of the car back at home.\n\nIt was fairly early in the morning, after sunrise but before 8am. I had been working the going to work business in the 400 and 500 zones. It had been raining off and on and was a very gray morning. Norwood is one of Birmingham’s grand old neighborhoods that fell into decline and disrepair after the white flight. Big houses that were once elegant mansions line some of the streets. A few of them, a very few, have been bought in recent years and renovated back to their former glory. Most are still in sad shape, some repairable with a major effort. Others that are burned out or literally falling down are beyond repair. This call wasn’t to an old mansion but to a decent home in good shape."

        "content": "She was sitting on the front porch when I drove up. A young girl, no doubt a teenager, jumped up and immediately got in the back seat. “How much will it cost to take me to Bessemer?” she asked. i said probably about $40, maybe more, depending on where it is in Bessemer. At first I didn’t worry about getting stiffed because most passengers that intend to stiff you don’t ask for an estimate. That’s because they’re not planning on paying you anyway.\n\nOn the way to Bessemer I learned that she was 16 and she had been out all night with boys that her mother didn’t like. She anticipated a big fight with her mother when she got home and was clearly anxious about it. She didn’t tell me but I instinctively knew that my fare would depend on an angry, possibly hysterical mother paying me. I started to worry. When we arrived at the house the meter was at $42 and mom was nowhere to be found. My customer’s brother said that he thought she had been called to work but he wasn’t sure. The girl made no attempt to call her mom. Maybe she couldn’t take calls at work or maybe it was just out of fear, I don’t know.\n\nThe girl was about to panic. “I don’t know how I’m going to pay you” she said. I had just been stiffed by the payday loan girl about a week earlier and I wasn’t in the mood to get stiffed again. I had already decided that I would call the cops if it became necessary. She approached the car window and said “I’ve got this little bracelet, it’s made of silver and gold. If I can pawn it I’ll pay you.” She saw that the meter was at $42 already and was able to reason that by the time she got to the pawn shop and took the necessary time to pawn it, the fare would be much higher. She asked if I could just charge her a flat rate. I told her that if she didn’t mess around and take too much of my time I would turn the meter off and just charge her the $42, she agreed.\n\nThe first place turned her down cold. The second place had a sign out front that said “We Buy Gold”. She stayed in this place for about ten minutes. She came out accompanied by a bling wearing heavyweight dude that reminded me of Biggie Smalls. The rain had started to fall steadily as the big guy knocked on my window. He had a $100 bill in his hand. He asked “you got fifty eight dollars?” I dug around in my pockets and found that I did indeed have fifty eight dollars. Just as we made the transaction my customer said “you don’t have to worry about taking me back home.” She and Biggie walked back into the office. I got paid and I don’t know how the story ended with her mom."

These days however “issues” are all over the place and you can pretty much guarantee the word will be used several times in a single interview broadcast.\n\nI sent a text to Five Live the other day to congratulate John Hutton, the Minister for Work and Pensions, who somehow managed to do a 10-minute interview, without using the word once! Funnily enough my comments were not read out on the air.  Presumably this was because the presenter had “issues” and used the word regularly himself!\n\nTotally agree .

Indeed, instead of \"problem\", \"difficulty\", \"complaint\", \"enquiry\" and so on, everything in the world of business, government and so many organisations of all colours these days, is an \"issue\". In particular when it comes to contacting a company to make a complaint there is a subtle psychology at work here when instead of admitting incompetence, shortcomings, inefficiency etc., it's all referred to as being \"an issue\": the reason for this is that the use of the word \"issue\" in this context is an attempt to neutralise any potential admission of guilt or wrong doing; e.g. I contacted my internet service provider once to complain about the slowness of their rectifying a fault and was told \"we have looked into your account and have not found any issues there\". Give me strength! The overuse of \"issue\" however is only but one example of ghastly corporate-speak which is all part of Amercan degrading of the English language.\n18/09/13 Simon\n2\n\nWhat gets me going is all the hand flapping and arm waving by tv presenters , do we really need these affected gestures to emphasise every word some of the experts on antique road show , among others are awful ,it's very distracting\n12/08/13 nell\n-2\n\nGet back to work\n\nMicheal, it's nit picking twots like you that really pee people off.

        "content": "You could say our team here at Heavenly Tea Leaves has a thing for Japanese culture, and of course, Japanese tea. Japan is a country that is revered for its ancient history, rich traditions, and pride in quality and care for every product they grow or create. Because among our team members we've visited Japan a number of times, we've developed a special interest in all types of teas from this Pacific nation--and we don't just mean matcha!\n\nOriginally sought after as medicine, tea was first brought to Japan by Chinese monks in the 8th century and was first consumed by the upper class (Samurai) and priests in Japan. The archipelago proved to have the right climate and terrain for growing tea; to this day, tea is cultivated in almost all regions of the country. Access to tea by the greater public did not come around until the Middle Ages. Influenced by Zen Buddhism, the Japanese tea ceremony (known as chanoyu or chado) developed as a unique practice with its own specialty teas and clean esthetics.\n\nJapan focuses mostly on green tea, which serves the benefit of lively and deep flavor, a plethora of healthy properties, and a steady stream of energy. Not all Japanese green teas are made the same, however. Here, we will take a closer look at the various tea types, both popular and rare, that you'll need to add to your South Pacific tea repertoire!\n\nWe always love to start off with a bang; in this case, that bang is a cup of rejuvenating Gyokuro green tea. Gyokuro is a green tea for those looking for umami flavor (perfect for the AM hours). Thanks to a unique processing method at the final stages of this tea plant's growth, it is shaded, leading to a higher chlorophyll content than the typical green tea, as well as a deep, rich green color and grassy, vegetal flavor.\n\nFor a nuttier variation, try Genmaicha Japan. Also a green tea, this one is known as the \"people's tea\" in Japan because it was economical to include toasted rice in the home blend; this tea doubles down on your umami senses thanks to the presence of popcorn and fire-roasted rice alongside a classic, rich green tea. The result? A party in your mouth that won't be ending any time soon.\n\nSometimes, though, we like to climb the green tea ladder. One of the more lavish Japanese tea experiences you can have is with our Kukicha. What makes this one special is that it contains stems and stalks left over from sencha and matcha tea production, so it utilizes the entire plant. Once considered peasant's tea, this variety is now known as a delicacy in Japan because of its natural sweetness and laundry list of health benefits.\n\nLooking for yet another Japanese green? Our well-rounded Zen Super Green is the answer for those looking for the consistency of regular tea but the potency of matcha (which in turn is made from first-flush spring Gyokuro). This blend of organic sencha and matcha green tea powder is the perfect balance between strong and delicate and finishes with a velvety, umami, vegetal mouthfeel. Be careful not to brew this and other delicate green teas at higher than 170 degrees, as you may burn the tea and extract unwanted bitterness!\n\nAs you may know, we're total matcha lovers. In fact, we've written an ode to matcha already--check it out! Matcha is a fine green tea powder that's super-concentrated in flavor, texture, and health benefits. It's made by simply whisking the powder into boiling water (and perhaps adding frothed milk and sugar if you're going for a matcha latte!). Our ceremonial-grade 30-gram matcha tin contains hand-picked and stone-ground green tea and come ready to brew.\n\nHojicha, which has a distinct roasted taste, is another signature Japanese blend carried by Heavenly Tea Leaves. So, what's the conclusion? Japan is definitely a tea destination worth learning about (and visiting), and its green teas are quite varied and totally spectacular. Japan's rich and detail-oriented culture shines brightly through their ability to manufacture some of the world's most premium green teas. Which one will you get your hands on this spring?\n\nP.S. Stay tuned to our Instagram page (@heavenlytea) for some photos of our latest trip to the majestic tea fields of Wazuka, Japan!"

(Yonhap)\nThe top diplomats of South Korea, the United States and Japan will hold trilateral talks on the margins of a Group of Seven (G-7) gathering in London later this week, a source said Tuesday, as Washington eyes a thaw in strained ties between its Asian allies.\n\nThe meeting between Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong, and his US and Japanese counterparts, Antony Blinken and Toshimitsu Motegi, respectively, is set to take place Wednesday, as they gathered in the British capital for the session of G-7 foreign and development ministers.\n\nThe meeting will mark the first direct engagement between Chung and Motegi, as Chung's overtures for dialogue with the Japanese minister had fallen on deaf ears amid tensions over Tokyo's wartime forced labor, sexual slavery and export curbs.\n\nOn Monday, Chung said he may also meet with Motegi bilaterally after the trilateral meeting, but it still remains uncertain if their talks will take place.\n\nThe three-way meeting has been arranged amid concerns that prolonged spats between South Korea and Japan would undercut America's efforts to revitalize its regional democratic alliance network in the face of China's growing assertiveness and North Korea's nuclear threats.\n\nRelations between Seoul and Tokyo have shown no signs of improvement due to historical spats stemming from Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula, as well as its recent decision to discharge radioactive water from its crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant.\n\nAt their talks, Chung, Blinken and Motegi are expected to discuss a coordinated strategy on North Korea.\n\nLast week, the White House said that the Joe Biden administration had completed its review of policy toward Pyongyang, and that it will seek a \"calibrated, practical\" approach toward the goal of the complete denuclearization of the peninsula.\n\nThe three sides could also discuss pending global issues, such as the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, distribution of vaccines and climate change.\n\nSouth Korea, the US and Japan held their last trilateral foreign ministerial meeting on the sidelines of an international security forum in Germany in February last year.\n\nThough not party to the G-7 grouping, South Korea, Australia, India, South Africa and Brunei, the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, have been invited to the forum as guests.

        "content": "Breaking Down the Offensive Line\n\nWhen Shawn Elliott was named the head coach at Georgia State, South Carolina head coach Will Muschamp turned to a familiar face for Gamecock fans, selecting Eric Wolford to lead the offensive line in 2017. Wolford previously served as the Gamecocks’ offensive line coach for one season during the Steve Spurrier Era, before taking a head coaching position of his own. He returns to Columbia after spending the past two years working with NFL offensive lineman as part of the San Francisco 49ers organization.\n\nWolford will be tasked with developing a formidable line that can create holes for the backs and provide enough protection for quarterback Jack Bentley that he is able to get the ball in the hands of the talented array of playmakers.\n\nWolford is blessed to have an offensive line that boasts a wealth of experience. Cory Helms (36 starts) and Alan Knott (29) have logged the most starting assignments on the squad. Zack Bailey (18), Malik Young (9), D.J. Park (3) and Donell Stanley (1) also have gained starting experience, as the unit has totaled 96 combined starts.\n\nSeniors Helms (6-4, 309) and Knott (6-4, 290) figure to hold down the right guard and center positions respectively in their final campaign. Both played through injuries during the 2016 campaign, but begin 2017 healthy and poised to have their best seasons in the Garnet & Black.\n\nAll-SEC candidate Zack Bailey (6-6, 311) transitioned from left guard to right tackle in the spring and figures to be the starter at that position, although the junior from Summerville, S.C., could certainly move back inside if the situation dictated that move.\n\nThe left side of the line entered fall camp a little more unsettled. Junior Donell Stanley (6-4, 317) looks to have nailed down the starting left guard job, while junior Malik Young (6-3, 303) and junior college transfer Dennis Daley (6-6, 330) continue to battle it out for the left tackle spot. Young has been the more consistent performer in fall camp but Daley has made this position battle one of the more interesting ones to watch as the season progresses.\n\nCoach Wolford would like to find at least eight offensive linemen he feels the Gamecocks can win with if they are put in the game. The second-team unit in fall camp has consisted of redshirt freshman Sadarius Hutcherson (6-4, 316) at left guard, redshirt freshman Chandler Farrell (6-2, 292) at center, senior D.J. Park (6-4, 337) at right guard and junior Blake Camper (6-8, 310) at right tackle, although Wolford likes to cross-train his linemen to be versatile enough to play more than one position. Park is especially versatile and is likely the first man in should a change be made at any of the spots other than left tackle.\n\nRedshirt sophomores Trey Derouen (6-3, 305) and Christian Pellage (6-6, 296) have each earned a letter since their arrival on campus and figure to provide additional depth. They are joined by returnees Ryan Green, Cameron Johnson and Will Putnam, who are all in their second year in the program.\n\nFour true freshmen scholarship players are on campus and getting their first taste of a fall camp. While it would appear that all four are likely headed for a redshirt season, a common occurrence among offensive linemen, the quartet of Summie Carlay, Jordon Carty, Eric Douglas and Jordan Rhodes all hope that the year spent on the practice fields and in the weight room with head strength & conditioning coach Jeff Dillman and his staff, will begin to pay dividends with playing time, possibly as early as 2018."
