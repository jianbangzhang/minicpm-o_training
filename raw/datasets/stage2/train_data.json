I had just dropped off a customer in Fairfield and was heading back toward downtown. I booked into the 200 zone as I approached the Arkadelphia Road exit. I immediately recieved a call to an address I knew to be in the Elyton project.\n\nThe cell phone seemed to be a permanant attachment to her body. She didn’t take it down from her ear until we had reached our destination. She was young, I’d say about 20. She was thin and dressed cheaply, a red bandana covered her hair. She quickly told me where she wanted to go, a payday/title loan place on Greensprings Highway. She was talking with someone who was obviously selling her something. I overheard talk of shipping options, dates of arrival ect…Whatever it was, I guess she really wanted it. So much so that she would call a cab to take her to get a loan to buy a money order in order to buy it, whatever it was.\n\nShe didn’t stay in the place very long, she was turned down quickly. It seems the only payday she had was a government check for a little more than two hundred dollars a month. She had no car to pawn the title to, she was S.O.L and so was I. She already owed me more than $20 by this time. Once it became clear that she had no means of paying the fare I just turned the meter off and told her I would take her home but let her know in no uncertain terms that I didn’t have to. I could have, and probably should have, just left her ass stranded there.\n\nI gave her a lecture on the way home about why she should make sure she had money before she called a cab. I told her that I could have called the cops and that most drivers would have called them. “Fo’ real?” she asked. “Fo’ what?” She had no idea that stiffing a cab driver could possibly be against the law. I told her it was called theft of service, which is similar to theft of property, like shoplifting from a store.”Naw it ain’t” she said. It seemed to me that this young woman had grown to adulthood without a clue as to how to function in society. Pitiful, I thought. At least she did offer a “thank you” as she got out of the car back at home.\n\nIt was fairly early in the morning, after sunrise but before 8am. I had been working the going to work business in the 400 and 500 zones. It had been raining off and on and was a very gray morning. Norwood is one of Birmingham’s grand old neighborhoods that fell into decline and disrepair after the white flight. Big houses that were once elegant mansions line some of the streets. A few of them, a very few, have been bought in recent years and renovated back to their former glory. Most are still in sad shape, some repairable with a major effort. Others that are burned out or literally falling down are beyond repair. This call wasn’t to an old mansion but to a decent home in good shape."}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00004.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "She was sitting on the front porch when I drove up. A young girl, no doubt a teenager, jumped up and immediately got in the back seat. “How much will it cost to take me to Bessemer?” she asked. i said probably about $40, maybe more, depending on where it is in Bessemer. At first I didn’t worry about getting stiffed because most passengers that intend to stiff you don’t ask for an estimate. That’s because they’re not planning on paying you anyway.\n\nOn the way to Bessemer I learned that she was 16 and she had been out all night with boys that her mother didn’t like. She anticipated a big fight with her mother when she got home and was clearly anxious about it. She didn’t tell me but I instinctively knew that my fare would depend on an angry, possibly hysterical mother paying me. I started to worry. When we arrived at the house the meter was at $42 and mom was nowhere to be found. My customer’s brother said that he thought she had been called to work but he wasn’t sure. The girl made no attempt to call her mom. Maybe she couldn’t take calls at work or maybe it was just out of fear, I don’t know.\n\nThe girl was about to panic. “I don’t know how I’m going to pay you” she said. I had just been stiffed by the payday loan girl about a week earlier and I wasn’t in the mood to get stiffed again. I had already decided that I would call the cops if it became necessary. She approached the car window and said “I’ve got this little bracelet, it’s made of silver and gold. If I can pawn it I’ll pay you.” She saw that the meter was at $42 already and was able to reason that by the time she got to the pawn shop and took the necessary time to pawn it, the fare would be much higher. She asked if I could just charge her a flat rate. I told her that if she didn’t mess around and take too much of my time I would turn the meter off and just charge her the $42, she agreed.\n\nThe first place turned her down cold. The second place had a sign out front that said “We Buy Gold”. She stayed in this place for about ten minutes.

Indeed, instead of \"problem\", \"difficulty\", \"complaint\", \"enquiry\" and so on, everything in the world of business, government and so many organisations of all colours these days, is an \"issue\". In particular when it comes to contacting a company to make a complaint there is a subtle psychology at work here when instead of admitting incompetence, shortcomings, inefficiency etc., it's all referred to as being \"an issue\": the reason for this is that the use of the word \"issue\" in this context is an attempt to neutralise any potential admission of guilt or wrong doing; e.g. I contacted my internet service provider once to complain about the slowness of their rectifying a fault and was told \"we have looked into your account and have not found any issues there\".

Japan is a country that is revered for its ancient history, rich traditions, and pride in quality and care for every product they grow or create. Because among our team members we've visited Japan a number of times, we've developed a special interest in all types of teas from this Pacific nation--and we don't just mean matcha!\n\nOriginally sought after as medicine, tea was first brought to Japan by Chinese monks in the 8th century and was first consumed by the upper class (Samurai) and priests in Japan. The archipelago proved to have the right climate and terrain for growing tea; to this day, tea is cultivated in almost all regions of the country. Access to tea by the greater public did not come around until the Middle Ages. Influenced by Zen Buddhism, the Japanese tea ceremony (known as chanoyu or chado) developed as a unique practice with its own specialty teas and clean esthetics.\n\nJapan focuses mostly on green tea, which serves the benefit of lively and deep flavor, a plethora of healthy properties, and a steady stream of energy. Not all Japanese green teas are made the same, however. Here, we will take a closer look at the various tea types, both popular and rare, that you'll need to add to your South Pacific tea repertoire!\n\nWe always love to start off with a bang; in this case, that bang is a cup of rejuvenating Gyokuro green tea. Gyokuro is a green tea for those looking for umami flavor (perfect for the AM hours). Thanks to a unique processing method at the final stages of this tea plant's growth, it is shaded, leading to a higher chlorophyll content than the typical green tea, as well as a deep, rich green color and grassy, vegetal flavor.\n\nFor a nuttier variation, try Genmaicha Japan. Also a green tea, this one is known as the \"people's tea\" in Japan because it was economical to include toasted rice in the home blend; this tea doubles down on your umami senses thanks to the presence of popcorn and fire-roasted rice alongside a classic, rich green tea. The result? A party in your mouth that won't be ending any time soon.\n\nSometimes, though, we like to climb the green tea ladder. One of the more lavish Japanese tea experiences you can have is with our Kukicha. What makes this one special is that it contains stems and stalks left over from sencha and matcha tea production, so it utilizes the entire plant. Once considered peasant's tea, this variety is now known as a delicacy in Japan because of its natural sweetness and laundry list of health benefits.\n\nLooking for yet another Japanese green? Our well-rounded Zen Super Green is the answer for those looking for the consistency of regular tea but the potency of matcha (which in turn is made from first-flush spring Gyokuro). This blend of organic sencha and matcha green tea powder is the perfect balance between strong and delicate and finishes with a velvety, umami, vegetal mouthfeel. Be careful not to brew this and other delicate green teas at higher than 170 degrees, as you may burn the tea and extract unwanted bitterness!\n\nAs you may know, we're total matcha lovers. In fact, we've written an ode to matcha already--check it out! Matcha is a fine green tea powder that's super-concentrated in flavor, texture, and health benefits. It's made by simply whisking the powder into boiling water (and perhaps adding frothed milk and sugar if you're going for a matcha latte!). Our ceremonial-grade 30-gram matcha tin contains hand-picked and stone-ground green tea and come ready to brew.\n\nHojicha, which has a distinct roasted taste, is another signature Japanese blend carried by Heavenly Tea Leaves. So, what's the conclusion? Japan is definitely a tea destination worth learning about (and visiting), and its green teas are quite varied and totally spectacular. Japan's rich and detail-oriented culture shines brightly through their ability to manufacture some of the world's most premium green teas. Which one will you get your hands on this spring?\n\nP.S.

Wolford previously served as the Gamecocks’ offensive line coach for one season during the Steve Spurrier Era, before taking a head coaching position of his own. He returns to Columbia after spending the past two years working with NFL offensive lineman as part of the San Francisco 49ers organization.\n\nWolford will be tasked with developing a formidable line that can create holes for the backs and provide enough protection for quarterback Jack Bentley that he is able to get the ball in the hands of the talented array of playmakers.\n\nWolford is blessed to have an offensive line that boasts a wealth of experience. Cory Helms (36 starts) and Alan Knott (29) have logged the most starting assignments on the squad. Zack Bailey (18), Malik Young (9), D.J. Park (3) and Donell Stanley (1) also have gained starting experience, as the unit has totaled 96 combined starts.\n\nSeniors Helms (6-4, 309) and Knott (6-4, 290) figure to hold down the right guard and center positions respectively in their final campaign. Both played through injuries during the 2016 campaign, but begin 2017 healthy and poised to have their best seasons in the Garnet & Black.\n\nAll-SEC candidate Zack Bailey (6-6, 311) transitioned from left guard to right tackle in the spring and figures to be the starter at that position, although the junior from Summerville, S.C., could certainly move back inside if the situation dictated that move.\n\nThe left side of the line entered fall camp a little more unsettled. Junior Donell Stanley (6-4, 317) looks to have nailed down the starting left guard job, while junior Malik Young (6-3, 303) and junior college transfer Dennis Daley (6-6, 330) continue to battle it out for the left tackle spot. Young has been the more consistent performer in fall camp but Daley has made this position battle one of the more interesting ones to watch as the season progresses.\n\nCoach Wolford would like to find at least eight offensive linemen he feels the Gamecocks can win with if they are put in the game. The second-team unit in fall camp has consisted of redshirt freshman Sadarius Hutcherson (6-4, 316) at left guard, redshirt freshman Chandler Farrell (6-2, 292) at center, senior D.J. Park (6-4, 337) at right guard and junior Blake Camper (6-8, 310) at right tackle, although Wolford likes to cross-train his linemen to be versatile enough to play more than one position. Park is especially versatile and is likely the first man in should a change be made at any of the spots other than left tackle.\n\nRedshirt sophomores Trey Derouen (6-3, 305) and Christian Pellage (6-6, 296) have each earned a letter since their arrival on campus and figure to provide additional depth. They are joined by returnees Ryan Green, Cameron Johnson and Will Putnam, who are all in their second year in the program.\n\nFour true freshmen scholarship players are on campus and getting their first taste of a fall camp. While it would appear that all four are likely headed for a redshirt season, a common occurrence among offensive linemen, the quartet of Summie Carlay, Jordon Carty, Eric Douglas and Jordan Rhodes all hope that the year spent on the practice fields and in the weight room with head strength & conditioning coach Jeff Dillman and his staff, will begin to pay dividends with playing time, possibly as early as 2018."}]}, {"type": "interleaved", "items": [{"type": "text", "content": "“‘Gauguin: Metamorphoses,’ which opens on Friday at MoMA in New York, recasts the artist as an altogether darker figure, closer to Edvard Munch and the dark pre-Freudians of Northern Europe than the post-impressionist confraternity of Van Gogh, Seurat and Cézanne,” Jason Farago wrote in his review (“Gauguin: Metamorphoses review – ‘Forceful, disturbing, obscene’,” Guardian, 6 March 2014) of the blockbuster exhibition that I was lucky enough to see before it closed, and it was indeed a revelation that shifted my view of this seminal artist."}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00017.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "There is on the one hand the exoticization & objectification of Tahitian women, which is objectionable particularly in relation to the relationships he had with them; but on the other hand, there is also his primitivism, which is not simply an exoticization of a foreign culture by a colonial tourist, but is in fact the expression of a longing for & even reconstruction of a lost pagan culture that had already nearly disappeared when Gauguin arrived in Tahiti.

Launch is expected at 7:20 a.m. ET.\nThe telescope has endured years of delays, including a combination of factors brought on by the pandemic and technical challenges. But the world’s most powerful complex space observatory will answer questions about our solar system, study exoplanets in new ways and look deeper into the universe than we’ve ever been able to.\n\nIt’s a project that has taken 30 years to design and build and is regarded as one of the grand scientific endeavours of the 21st Century.\n\nWebb’s goal will be to try to show the very first stars and galaxies to shine in the Universe.\n\nIt will also have the power to probe the atmospheres of distant planets to look for gases that might hint at the presence of life.\n\nThe anticipation is high, but so too is the level of anxiety.\n\nTo get to space, Webb must first survive a 27-minute ascent on what is, in effect, a controlled explosion.\n\nThe telescope then has to unfold itself in a series of complex deployments, all of which must be completed flawlessly or the observatory as a whole won’t work.\n\n“It’s a shining example of what we can accomplish when we dream big. We’ve always known that this project would be a risky endeavour. But, of course, when you want a big reward, you have to usually take a big risk.”\n\nThe James Webb telescope is named after one of the architects of the Apollo Moon programme, and the space agencies of the US, Europe and Canada, who are all partners on the project, regard it as a science flagship of no less importance.\n\nWebb’s mission is to build on the discoveries of the Hubble Space Telescope, which, after 31 years in orbit, is nearing the end of operations.\n\nWebb will look deeper into the cosmos and, as a consequence, much further back in time.\n\nAt the core of the new facility’s capabilities is its 6.5m-wide golden mirror.\n\nThis remarkable reflecting surface, allied to four super-sensitive instruments, should enable Webb to detect the light from the pioneer stars. These objects are theorised to have ignited more than 13.5 billion years ago.\n\n“We think there should be stars, or galaxies, or black holes maybe beginning at 100 million years after the Big Bang. There won’t be many of them to find at that time but the Webb telescope can see them if they’re there, and we’re lucky,” he told BBC News.\n\nThe pioneer stars are more than a mere curiosity. They began the process of seeding the cosmos with the first heavy chemical elements.\n\nThe calcium in our bones, the phosphorus in our DNA and the iron in our blood – all these atoms had to be “manufactured” in the nuclear reactions that make stars shine, and in the mighty explosions that end their existence.\n\nIn this sense, Webb will be charting our origins.\n\n“One of my favourite things about astronomy in general is that it really gets right down to our big questions: Where do we come from? How did we get here? Are we alone? These questions are more than just arcane science questions; they’re questions that get to the heart of what it means to be human,” said Nasa deputy project scientist Dr Amber Straughn.\n\nSaturday’s flight to orbit involves one of the most dependable rockets in the business. The Ariane-5 has a greater than 98% record of success. Its last outright failure was in 2002.\n\nThe less-than-2% rate reflects the hazards that inevitably come with handling such an extreme vehicle.\n\nPeople will naturally focus on it – there are no guarantees in the rocket business – but it’s fair to say that few Ariane missions have been subjected to the same level of detailed scrutiny as this one.\n\nEngineers have reviewed every aspect of the vehicle’s performance. All questions have been answered.\n\nThe Ariane will fly east from Kourou, out over the Atlantic towards Africa.\n\nA signal confirming Webb is in space and safe should be picked up by a ground antenna in Malindi, Kenya.\n\nThis will mark the start then of a month-long journey for the telescope as it moves out to its planned observing station 1.5 million km from Earth.\n\nCharles Igbinidu is a Public Relations practitioner in Lagos, Nigeria\n@https://twitter.com/ionigeria\nPrevious Former England and Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge ordered to pay $30,000 to man who found his missing dog\nNext I now believe in the power of prayer – not because it works, but because it helps"}]}, {"type": "interleaved", "items": [{"type": "text", "content": "Police: Man charged with OWI told an officer boozy smell must have been his spearmint gum\n\nThe Wausau man's 4-year-old daughter was in the car at the time of the traffic stop, according to court records.\n\nPolice: Man charged with OWI told an officer boozy smell must have been his spearmint gum"}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00056.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "ROTHSCHILD - Police say a man charged with OWI said the smell of alcohol an officer detected during a traffic stop must have been his spearmint gum.\n\nMark Pierzchalski of Wausau was charged Monday with a felony count of a fifth or sixth OWI with a passenger who is under 16 years old, according to Marathon County court records.

The Ibérico pig has characteristically long slender legs, a sensitive snout to forage with, and dark skin to help protect it in the sun. The ham it produces is popularly known as pata negra, referring to the black hoof which stays on the slim leg throughout the curing process. and makes it look very different from other hams.\n\nHow to buy Ibérico ham\n\nBuying Ibérico ham can be confusing, particularly if you are not familiar with the descriptions used; the one thing everyone knows is that it is expensive, but how much should it cost?\n\nIt was in an attempt to bring some clarity to the consumer that the Spanish government introduced a law in April, 2014 to clarify and standardise the descriptions of different types of Iberico ham.\n\nThe four grades of Ibérico Ham\n\nSimply put, the legislation sets out four different grades of Ibérico ham. It is based on the pigs' diet and the purity of breed. By simply looking at the official description the consumer can make an educated choice about the quality, and hence the price, of their ham.\n\nThe four grades that were created are indicated on any Ibérico ham or paleta (cured shoulder) on the bone by a tag (precinto)around the ankle, or on any boneless Ibérico ham, paleta or cured loin by a tag attached to the sealed piece. These tags are essentially legal indicators of how the Ibérico pigs were raised and fattened and what the minimum curing time of the ham was."}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00057.png"}, {"type": "text", "content": "The top grade of Ibérico ham goes by the full description of “Jamon de bellota, 100% Ibérico, ‘pata negra’”. Jamon de bellota signifies that the Ibérico pig fattened up on acorns (bellotas) on the autumn “montanera” when the animals are put to forage on the dehesa, the oak covered savannah that makes up several million hectares of the south west of the Iberian peninsula. 100% Ibérico means that it is a pure-bred animal, and pata Negra is a term that used to be used generically for any Ibérico ham, but now can only be used to describe this top grade of ham. Hams and paletas will have a black tag around the ankle, issued by the relevant regional body.\n\nThe second grade is described as “Jamon de bellota, 50/75% Ibérico”, which means that the animal has undergone the montanera, but that either one parent, or one grandparent was of non-Ibérico origin. When cross-breeding does occur the mother will always be 100% Iberico and the boar must be of the Duroc breed. This cross-breeding has two functions, firstly to prevent continual inbreeding, never a good idea, and also, to breed animals which will have more progeny and, frequently, larger back legs. Hams and paletas from these animals will have a red tag around the ankle.\n\nThese are the only grades of Ibérico ham made from animals that have fattened up on acorns and they account for about 20% of all Ibérico hams.\n\nThe third grade is called “Jamon de cebo de campo, 50/75/100% Ibérico” which indicates that the animal lived outdoors but fattened up on cereals and natural feed before slaughter. This means that the quality of the meat will excellent, but lacking the deep, sweet intensity of the acorn-fed hams. This accounts for a further 20% of Ibérico hams.\n\nThe fourth grade is the one that tends to cause confusion; “Jamon de cebo, 50/75/100% Ibérico” indicates, in essence that the ham will almost certainly have been intensively reared. Where the minimum space required per animal for the top three grades during the fattening period is 1 hectare (100m²), the minimum required for this grade is 2m²! Simply put, this is the grade that can be made from intensively reared animals, and thus significantly more cheaply than the other grades of Ibérico ham. This grade accounts for 60% of all Ibérico ham production.\n\nWhy the Ibérico grades are so important\n\nThis information can help you understand the welfare standards of the pig rearing and the pricing of Ibérico hams. However, it also shows something more fundamental; it offers you the opportunity to make a choice about being part of a continuum that extends back 3,000 years. The dehesa is a unique environment that has been shaped by the indigenous animals of the region, and has shaped them too. This huge area has more endangered species of bird and animal life than anywhere else in Western Europe due to this slow evolution. By choosing a ham made from an animal that has followed innumerable generations of its ancestors living and feeding on the dehesa, you are helping to maintain an ecosystem whose environmental value is immense.\n\nThe bellota and cebo de campo animals have a symbolic relationship with their environment, and one which does wonders for the quality of meat. The jamon de cebo is essentially a commercial construct and it is a means by which the larger, more industrial ham producers can produce and sell a premium priced product under the cloak of respectability created by the origins of the higher grades of ham. This is not to say that there may not be some good jamon de cebo Ibérico hams, but that those produced to the minimum requirements are unlikely to be among them.\n\nWhen buying Ibérico ham, you can certainly make an ethical choice. You can choose to buy a product made from a free ranging animal that forages on the foods that they have evolved to consume over many thousands of years, and is arguably the most magnificent ham in the world, or whether you want a very decent ham at a cheaper price whose provenance does not concern you."}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00058.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "by Monika Linton | Founder of Brindisa\n\nWhen we first started bringing in de bellota Ibérico ham, before there was any real acceptance or understanding of it in Britain, I gave a wonderful ham to chef Simon Hopkinson, then at Bibendum, who was very excited by the arrival of this delicacy. His instincts were right; he simply sliced it and sent it out to diners, but the plates came back with the fat trimmed off and customers wanting to know why it was there. I was duly called over to the restaurant to confirm that the ratio of fat to lean was perfectly normal and exactly as it should be.\n\nIt was an absurd misunderstanding of a fine product that seemed so characteristic of modern meat production and consumption, which has all fat marked out by many people as almost criminal. Simon did, however, have one customer who genuinely appreciated and understood fine fat; the late great artist Francis Bacon.

The mercurial, brilliant entrepreneur offloaded around $8.5 billion of Tesla stock this week as he prepared to pay for his $44 billion side project. And soon, he’ll be free to change the service as he pleases.\n\nMusk hasn’t yet presented a comprehensive plan for Twitter — he may never — but he’s proposed several significant changes worth evaluating. Musk’s ideas include lengthening character limits, open sourcing the algorithm, and effectively putting an end to content moderation. A debate is raging about the latter, but all have tradeoffs.\n\nAlex Roetter, Twitter’s former head of engineering, joined Big Technology Podcast this week to discuss Musk’s proposals, examining both their feasibility and advisability. Here’s a look at the most significant potential changes, along with his commentary:\n\nUpon announcing the deal, Musk said he wanted to “authenticate all humans.” Twitter has long weighed this idea internally, wondering whether making people confirm their email or phone number could help reduce harassment and spam. The company never acted, perhaps because authentication could drop its user numbers and anger Wall Street. But it should’ve. Pure anonymity, Roetter said, “fosters the worst parts of speech online.” So he loves Musk’s authentication idea. As a private company, Twitter could afford to take a user number hit, a benefit of Musk’s ownership. This idea is feasible and advisable.\n\nMusk hates the spambots. “We will defeat the spam bots or die trying!” he said last week. Roetter likes this idea, but it’s not that simple. To defeat the spambots, he said, you’d build a classifier that looks for characteristics of bots and then bans them. You’d then tune the classifier to either be really aggressive, where you’d eliminate bots but also ban a bunch of human “false positives,” or be less aggressive, where you’d let some bots slide and ban fewer humans. “I think you should do it,’ Roetter said. “But everyone should be prepared, there is no perfect spam bot classifier.” This idea is feasible, though not perfect, and advisable.\n\nAllowing for free speech is core to Musk’s Twitter takeover. “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square,” he said. There may be technical challenges to Musk’s vision, including how that victory against spambots could ensnare human speech as well, said Roetter. “I really don’t think there’s an answer that’s going to make everybody happy,” he said. Still, Musk could relax the current moderation rules and see how things play out. This move is somewhat feasible and its advisability is TBD.\n\nMusk is interested in Twitter’s subscription product and could expand it. Making people pay for Twitter — or certain premium features — could help reduce spam and create a revenue stream if Twitter’s advertisers bail over its new speech rules. “It’s a really interesting idea,” Roetter said. “If you don’t want a bunch of what you think of as low-value activity to happen, if you charge more than the value that you think people are extracting from it, it should go away.” Subscription fees could be normalized and scaled per location. This idea is feasible and advisable if implemented right.\n\nTo build trust in Twitter, Musk wants to open-source its algorithms. “This one is a head-scratcher to me,” Roetter said. The algorithms themselves, he said, won’t tell you very much. To figure out what to show you, Twitter’s ranking algorithms essentially look at billions of examples of content, try to predict how you’ll react to tweets and ads, and then use those scores to optimize what to show you. “It doesn’t say, if you are Republican, then you’re banned,” Roetter said. “There’s just nothing like that.” Open sourcing the algorithms is feasible and perhaps advisable, but only to dispel the conspiracy theories.\n\nMusk has mused about adding an edit button and allowing lengthier tweets. Both ideas are technically straightforward, though they’ll probably do little for everyday users who can already thread tweets together and delete and resend tweets with typos. “I don’t think it’s going to change any of the main things that everyone is upset about,” Roetter said. “But yeah, sure, why not?” These ideas are feasible and, well, it’s up to you Elon."}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00064.jpg"}]}, {"type": "interleaved", "items": [{"type": "text", "content": "Apple dominated the news cycle yesterday with its iPhone 12 press event.

Alfred Prufrock\", commonly known as \"Prufrock\", is the first professionally published poem by American-born British poet T. S. Eliot (1888–1965). Eliot began writing \"Prufrock\" in February 1910, and it was first published in the June 1915 issue of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse at the instigation of Ezra Pound (1885–1972). It was later printed as part of a twelve-poem pamphlet (or chapbook) titled Prufrock and Other Observations in 1917. At the time of its publication, Prufrock was considered outlandish, but is now seen as heralding a paradigmatic cultural shift from late 19th-century Romantic verse and Georgian lyrics to Modernism. The poem's structure was heavily influenced by Eliot's extensive reading of Dante Alighieri and makes several references to the Bible and other literary works—including William Shakespeare's plays Henry IV Part II, Twelfth Night, and Hamlet, the poetry of seventeenth-century metaphysical poet Andrew Marvell, and the nineteenth-century French Symbolists. Eliot narrates the experience of Prufrock using the stream of consciousness technique developed by his fellow Modernist writers. The poem, described as a \"drama of literary anguish\", is a dramatic interior monologue of an urban man, stricken with feelings of isolation and an incapability for decisive action that is said \"to epitomize frustration and impotence of the modern individual\" and \"represent thwarted desires and modern disillusionment\". Prufrock laments his physical and intellectual inertia, the lost opportunities in his life and lack of spiritual progress, and he is haunted by reminders of unattained carnal love. With visceral feelings of weariness, regret, embarrassment, longing, emasculation, sexual frustration, a sense of decay, and an awareness of mortality, \"Prufrock\" has become one of the most recognised voices in modern literature. Among the most significant works by Eliot's: \"Portrait of a Lady\", \"Preludes\", \"Whispers of Immortality\", \"Gerontion\", \"The Waste Land\", \"The Hollow Men\", \"Ash Wednesday\", Ariel Poems\", \"Journey of the Magi\", \"A Song for Simeon\", \"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats\", \"The Awefull Battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles\", \"Gus: The Theatre Cat\", \"Growltiger's Last Stand\", \"The Naming of Cats\", \"Burnt Norton\", \"East Coker\", \"The Dry Salvages\", \"Little Gidding\", \"Four Quartets\".\n\nThe Waste Land and Other Poems\n\nLong regarded as one of the fundamental texts of modernism, a treasury of many of T.

Published following the successful appearance of \"The Love Song of J.

Opening with \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,\" the collection begins with an invocation of Dante, whom Eliot saw as an important innovator of a polyphonic, referential poetry capable of interrogating and dramatizing the construction and representation of the self. The poem is written from the perspective of a repressed, despairing middle-aged man who meditates on his relationships with women and the regrets he has accumulated with age. In \"Preludes,\" a poem of urban malaise, Eliot \"thinks of all the hands / That are raising dingy shades / In a thousand furnished rooms,\" and reaches for an understanding of the world as \"some infinitely gentle / Infinitely suffering thing.\" Other poems include \"Morning at the Window,\" another brief vision of city life, \"The Boston Evening Transcript,\" a satirical reverie on time and community, and \"Cousin Nancy,\" a humorous lyric celebrating Miss Nancy Ellicott, who unabashedly \"smoked, / And danced all the modern dances.

This is a question recognized by people around the world. If typed into the internet, hundreds of examples appear. Many know that it comes from one of the best-known poems of the previous century, T. S. Eliotâs The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock. What many do not know is that Eliot dramatically shifted his views at the height of his fame for writing such dark poetry as this and The Waste Land, becoming a sincere, devoted Christian. While his poetry is famous because it expresses the loss of a spiritual center in European civilization, a careful reading of it reveals that he was struggling with his Christianity from the beginning, not rejecting it, but trying to make it fit into the contemporary world. If the reader works through Eliotâs love song for all of the esoteric meanings, as he demands, it quickly becomes evident that he intended it as a struggle between agape, amour and eros. Beginning it with a quote from Dante forces that into place. Though the protestant forms of Christianity have changed their views on these, the Roman Catholic holds fast. Eliot references Michelangelo in the poem, bringing in the great painter of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Most immediately recognize his name and work, but do not realize how he expressed a similar personal struggle between the desires of the flesh and the spirit. Both of them admired Danteâs Divine Comedy, and its inclusion of amour as a means to salvation. Danteâs work is generally seen as the greatest literature ever to come out of Italy. This book is an expanded revision of Seeking God in the Works of T. S. Eliot and Michelangelo. It explores how T.S Eliot struggled with the highest meanings of existence in his poetry and his own life, and perhaps managed to express what has become known as a modernist (and post-modernist) view of what Rudolph Otto designated the mysterium tremendum, the experience of a mystical awe, the experience of God."}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00070.jpg"}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00071.jpg"}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00072.jpg"}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00073.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "Let Us Go Then, You and I\n\nLet Us Go Then, You and I is a new edition of T.

(Photo courtesy of Philadelphia Citypaper)\n\nAustin is finally getting serious about urban planning. Last week at City Council, a fresh comprehensive planning process got the green light. For at least the next two years, we'll be engaged in a great civic conversation about the future of our built city. Yet no single community group in Austin is dedicated to advocating for good urban design. As we approach a rapid series of critical decisions, a number of the community's best and brightest urban-design and -planning minds have begun talking together about how they might better serve as watchdogs for the collective good. As trained professionals, they want better city planning and development decisions based as much as possible on objective design principles rather than political compromises.\n\nPhiladelphia's Design Advocacy Group offers an interesting model for Austin. Formed about seven years ago by a core group of six, including Chairman Alan Greenberger, DAG now claims nearly 1,000 members. By championing a \"Reform Agenda for Planning and Design in Philadelphia\" over several years – and having the good fortune to help elect new Mayor Michael Nutter, who has adopted its agenda as his own – DAG has become an amazingly effective community voice.\n\nThe all-volunteer group has no staff, no dues, and no formal organization. States the website (www.designadvocacy.org): \"Our goal is be proactive as well as reactive; effective as well as thoughtful; critical as well as constructive. We want to create an unparalleled voice for design, a group whose opinion on the quality of our environment is sought after and whose contribution makes a difference. We are a group drawn from a broad spectrum of disciplines, comprised of motivated individuals who are routinely engaged in matters of design, development and planning and who are not afraid to speak out.\"\n\nThat last point is crucial. Austinites tend toward polite public education and vociferous grumbling in private. What we lack is courageous, informed voices insisting on the recognized principles of good design and planning. (Greenberger enjoys saying, \"Advocacy is our middle name.\") DAG positions have been taken seriously due to the professional expertise and stature of its 28-member steering committee. Many are notable practicing architects. Others are University of Pennsylvania faculty members, some with the School of Design's \"clinical arm,\" PennPraxis, through which faculty and students work on community projects, such as the website PlanPhilly.com. (What a great idea for the Community and Regional Planning Program at the School of Archi­tec­ture at the University of Texas!) Others are professional planners who serve on city and regional planning commissions. Lay members include lawyers, builders, developers, preservationists, economists, students, and PR and marketing types. All that's required to \"join\" is to provide an e-mail address.\n\nAt DAG's open monthly meetings, \"a free and frank exchange of ideas is encouraged.\" Presentations on hot development projects and controversies draw a good crowd of 50 to 75 members. DAG's advocacy positions are honed after discussion at monthly meetings, a flurry of e-mails among the steering committee members to forge a consensus view, and a formal vote when necessary. To advance the cause, DAG hosts public forums such as \"Pride of Place\" on the design and planning issues relevant to a particular mayoral election. It has helped lead independent design charrettes for important projects such as Penn's Landing, a major waterfront development. DAG members provide expert testimony before government agencies, write letters to government agencies expressing positions, and publish white papers, op-eds, columns, and letters to the editor. Financial support has come from the William Penn Foundation.\n\nHow effective has the volunteer group's advocacy been? An early high-visibility fight was against the Jefferson Parking Garage, an ill-conceived, overscaled, neighborhood-blighting project for which Thomas Jefferson University and Hospital sought zoning variances. While DAG lost the battle for a complete redesign, the publicity put the group on the map. They also lost a battle – despite an emergency letter-writing campaign – to preserve historic buildings sneakily demolished by the state. But their major initiative – a Reform Agenda for Planning and Design in Philadelphia – has been a thrilling success. Within two weeks of taking office, Nutter named new professionals to the Planning Commission (including Green­berger as vice chair), the powerful Zoning Board of Adjustment, and the Zoning Code Commission – just as DAG had advocated. The reform agenda called for creating a new Civic Design Review Commission; the mayor is now pursuing it. After witnessing DAG's by-invitation design reviews of major projects, said Greenberger, \"Now the mayor is calling for the Planning Commission to set up a design-review operation based on the DAG model.\"\n\nAddressing the Philadelphia City Planning Commission last week, Nutter gave a stirring speech – from the mouth of DAG – that, if heard here, would make many Austinites weep with joy. Austin Planning Commissioner Tracy Atkins, who heard Nutter address the 2007 Congress for the New Urbanism conference in Philly, remembers: \"He impressed me then. He is young and energetic.\" Said Nutter: \"As a city government, we reject the 'let's make a deal' mentality that dominated the past. Monty Hall has left City Hall. ... Those days are over! ... Planning is not a luxury, nor is it a jargon-filled veneer obscuring a deal-making process that slices up a city's assets in a disorganized rush. ... It's not a passive system, simply responding to developers' proposals; it's proactive and sets high standards of design.\" (Download the full text here.)\n\nMarveled Greenberger: \"We've lost a lot of battles, but we're winning the war of reform. We can't believe it! None of us saw this coming.\"\n\n\"Developing Stories\" visited Philadelphia during the June 5-7 Association of Alternative Newsweek­lies Convention.

The purpose of this process had been to examine the local authority of the future and the result was future images of municipalities (in Finnish). Instead of commissioning external consultants for the project, the association had engaged its own experts, leaders and councillors on a broad basis.\n\nThey began by collecting signals onto a group board on Pinterest. They then arranged trends into groups and processed them, before seeking future visions within each area. On the basis of their future visions and interpretations, they went on to build prototypes of the municipal services of the future.\n\nWhen foresight activity is implemented in this way, the result is a process of collective learning among participants and stronger commitment to the final results. To those who make their living out of foresight work, there is nothing revolutionary about this. On the other hand, I view public organisations and decision-makers in particular as overly cautious about applying participatory foresight methods. I wonder how many municipal councillors or MPs have ever had any personal involvement in actual foresight work. And how many ministers? If you can think of any, please let me know in the comments section!\n\nWhen faced with foresight data that you need to process into visions and concrete services, you usually also encounter an entirely new outlook about which you might otherwise have been oblivious. I believe that, right now, as Finland slogs through a quagmire of austerity and despair, we need future-oriented work more than ever as the basis of future visions and foresight – particularly among political leaders at various levels. Many thanks to the Association of Finnish Local and Regional Authorities for taking bold steps forward with this!\n\nThe second aspect of my inspiration is associated with the previous one. At the event, we also heard of a municipality that is already turning its strong, future-oriented activity and faith into reality. That municipality is Pirkkala, which has given thought to its future vision as the political system changes and its municipal identity becomes based on something other than organising services. How to create an identity that places democracy and dynamism at the heart of municipal operations?\n\nPirkkala seems to have succeeded well in this. It is true that it had a good framework from the beginning: it is located next to the large city of Tampere, has good transport connections, a beautiful environment and a balanced municipal economy. Still, this is not enough if political leaders or civil servants lack the ability to reform and the willingness to attain a healthy governance culture. Pirkkala has had the will and ability to invest in both.\n\nWhat do measures taken to secure future competencies look like in concrete terms? Pirkkala’s vision is centred around a contented community and municipality which provides a lively, happy environment in which people want to settle. In other words, the municipality dares to connect well-being to happiness, not just service provision and other traditional factors. Strong trust between politicians, civil servants and local residents is promoting the implementation of this vision. They have no intention of paying mere lip service to the “facilitating role of civil servants”, but want to genuinely think about what facilitation means and the skills it requires. They are adopting social media tools and understand that their use requires new skills and approaches, from both politicians and civil servants. They view dynamism as being about tearing down boundaries and are willing to co-operate with partner cities across national frontiers.\n\nWith social and healthcare reform just around the corner, now is a good time to re-examine regional and municipal identities. Many regions are already doing so. Last month, the Pirkanmaa Future Forum mapped the factors of future success and more major regional foresight events have been penned in for the spring. I will comment on these closer to the actual events. Before then, I hope that as many people as possible throw down the gauntlet to decision-makers, challenging them to join in their foresight activities.\n\nWeekly notes is a series of blogs offering insights into the topical issues being discussed each week by Sitra’s research and strategy team.

They would know, from monitoring at Jodrell Bank (a big telescope observatory station) if missiles had been launched, and then the Government would bring into play klaxons, sirens and alarms to let everyone know that we had four minutes before the missiles would strike.\n\nGrowing up in the 80s, particularly in a city that was within a five mile radius of several RAF bases, and with left leaning teachers who were all signed up to “Save the Whale” and “CND”,  I spent most of my formative years having these three facts drilled into me :-\n\n(a)   You will need a degree to get a job, even a job stacking shelves, when you leave school, and there won’t be any jobs, thanks to “Mrs Thatch”\n\n(b)   If you have sex with anyone ever, you will almost certainly catch Aids and die\n\n(c)   You won’t know when nuclear war will come, and any day could bring that four minute warning, but it WILL come   [oh, and living where we do, you WILL be vapourised, no mutants and rebuilding society from the ashes for you, you will BE the ashes]\n\nThe school further emphasised point (c) by showing us the film “Threads” in which we saw a shopping centre not all that far from us get devastated by a fictitious nuclear war.  That certainly made going shopping at the weekend a much more haunting and terrifying experience. If there’s one thing worse than knowing you could be vapourised any moment, it is that you could spend your last moments alive trying on far too tight shoes in Clarks or looking in bad mirrors in Concept Man trying to work out if burgandy and mustard go together.\n\nWhat a cheery adolescence that was, alleviated only by “Axel F”,  Gauntlet, Star Wars figures, Nike trainers, New Order,  the Um Bongo advert, Wilma Deering’s lipgloss on “Buck Rogers”  and Frank McAvennie’s blonde perm [these things not necessarily in order of preference].\n\nSo, it suddenly struck me the other day, that having lived under the shadow of nuclear war, and the four minute warning, an existential horror so incomprehensibly unfathomable in modern society that the only way I can explain it is to suggest that it made certain sections of the British public think that Sting of all people, was very wise, provocative and deep in his song “I hope the Russians love their children too”\n\nthat I hadn’t thought about the four minute warning for years. Does it still exist?\n\nWould we get more time now, as with satellites and better computers we might know earlier that the nukes were being warmed up?  Or would we get less, because technology in rockets has advanced and they would fly quicker?\n\nThis, by the way, is the message that would have been read out on all radios and on the BBC.  It is, you will agree, a great comfort.\n\nHere is the cheeky opening which comes right out with the important bad news, just in case you were watching “Telly Addicts” and cursing that it had been interrupted by a party political broadcast. Don’t touch the “hoofer doofer” pops, this is it!\n\nThis is the Wartime Broadcasting Service. This country has been attacked with nuclear weapons. Communications have been severely disrupted, and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known. We shall bring you further information as soon as possible. Meanwhile, stay tuned to this wavelength, stay calm and stay in your own homes.\n\nRemember there is nothing to be gained by trying to get away. By leaving your homes you could be exposing yourselves to greater danger.\n\nIf you leave, you may find yourself without food, without water, without accommodation and without protection. Radioactive fall-out, which follows a nuclear explosion, is many times more dangerous if you are directly exposed to it in the open.\n\nI have to say, I personally find the idea of this warning being more comforting if I imagine it being read out by Hugh Grant’s character from “Four Weddings and a Funeral”   – done with much more beating around the bush and nervous embarrassment at having to say it at all.\n\n“Not quite sure how to say this, and I’m sure it comes as a bit of a shock to you all, it did to me, certainly, and I don’t really know why Mr Cameron asked me of all people to tell you, but the fact of the matter is… gosh, this is awkward. Hard to really know how to start. Is it best, all things being equal to break it gently, or just dive right on in there.\n\nImagine for me, if you will, the really absolutely worst thing I could be about to tell you. Imagine a bit harder. Are you thinking about mushroom clouds? If not, you’re not quite imagining the right thing… try again. In the words, perhaps of Michael Stipe, while he was still with REM in fact, it’s the end of the world as we know it. Erm, sorry.”\n\nSo, the news is, we no longer get a four minute warning. All of the klaxons and sirens have been dismantled (apart from, oddly, the one at Broadmoor). A combination of cost, difficulty of organisation, the realisation that the Electromagnetic Pulse that will accompany the nuclear missiles falling on nearer targets will probably wipe out electronic communication anyway, and oddly, the prevalence of double-glazing meaning that most people wouldn’t now hear the sirens, led to it being put to bed in the mid 1990s.\n\n[Only in England could Safestyle UK  “I say you buy one, you get one free” be the driving force behind ending the public’s right to know that nuclear annihilation was imminent]\n\nJudging from the conversations that we always had in the 80s about what we would do if the four minute warning came, cancelling it did not so much stop people carefully stockpiling water and salt and tinned fruit, as prevent a wave of pimply teenaged boys trying to cop off with any female in sight and “driving a yellow Lamborghini Countach at 160 miles an hour”\n\nI suspect that the reality of the situation would be that if we did get a four minute warning, there would just be utter panic, looting, a complete collapse of the internet and mobile signals as everyone tried to ring their loved ones/tweet something jaded and pithy about the war, and gridlock on the roads as everyone tried to either get home or get the hell out of the city.  [Or even more depressingly, people spending their last minutes watching that last episode of Broadchurch that they Skyplussed, on 16 x speed so they can die knowing who did it]\n\nJust forty truck drivers blocking our supply of petrol for five days achieved much the same thing, so it doesn’t seem unfathomable that we’d get similar if not worse meltdown from a genuine actual crisis.\n\nI suspect, that given that all that seems to be gained from a warning is panic and misery, that the Government wouldn’t actually get Hugh Grant on the television to tell you to stay indoors (using the protective power of your double glazing) and to save your tinned peaches for later.\n\nWhich means the only survivors of a nuclear attack on Britain would be pensioners (who are inside anyway, and have loads of tinned fruit), politicians (who get the secret warning and grabbed their expenses forms and headed to their bunker and drew up the Duck drawbridge), the inmates of Broadmoor, and people who were at home watching “Loose Women”.   What a glorious future we will have, when things are rebuilt.  Britain will be great again.\n\nThat was all a bit depressing.

She also reflects on her own childhood experiences in libraries; studies arson and the long history of library fires; attempts to burn a copy of a book herself; and re-examines the case of Harry Peak, the blond-haired actor long suspected of setting fire to the library over thirty years ago. Along the way, she reveals how these buildings provide much more than just books – and that they are needed now more than ever.\n\nAs a keen reader of books about books who also has an interest in non-violent and historical true crime, I was immediately interested in Susan Orlean’s The Library Book. It’s one of those multifaceted books that wears many hats – examining the devastating fire that decimated Los Angeles Central Library in 1986 and the personal history of the man accused of starting it, whilst at the same time providing an eclectic history of the Los Angeles library system and an examination of the role of the public library within our increasingly digital world.\n\nOrlean’s narrative is extremely dense and the book covers a lot of ground in it’s 300 or so pages. But the clear and engaging prose, which blends personal reflection with immersive journalism and factual history, drew me into the narrative and gave the book a compulsion.\n\nOrlean really captures the intensity of feeling that surrounds libraries and books. Her description of the library fire is devastating for a book lover to read – she really makes it easy to empathise with the librarians, who cried on the street as they watched over 400,000 items from their extensive collection go up in flames. In a fascinating chapter, Orlean burns a book herself; an act that she finds both terrifying and subversive. It’s a feeling that I completely understood and I found myself mourning the lost knowledge that was turned to ash on the morning of 29 April 1986.\n\nOrlean’s sensitive treatment of Harry Peak, the charismatic young actor suspected of setting the library fire, manages to convey both the fiercely-held belief that investigators had in Harry’s guilt whilst acknowledging the fallibility of fire investigation techniques and the circumstantial nature of the evidence available at the time.\n\nThat said, Harry’s narrative was, for me, the weakest part of the book – although that is the fault of history rather than of Orlean. Harry, a man who constantly re-wrote his own narrative, flits elusively through the pages and you definitely get the sense that Orlean, like many of the other people around him, struggles to pin him down. The Library Book is impeccably researched but, as Orlean admits, the truth about the library fire – and whether Harry had any involvement in it – will probably never be known. This does give the ending a slightly subdued quality – the pace drops off noticeably in the last third as it becomes apparent that this isn’t a mystery that will have a resolution. To Orlean’s credit, she instead turns the book into a love letter to libraries and a reflection on their importance in the world today.\n\nThe Library Book may disappoint readers looking for a true crime narrative. There are definitely similarities in pacing and style with David Grann’s excellent Killers of the Flower Moon and Michelle McNamara’s I’ll Be Gone in the Dark, but this is a very different kind of book in tone. The Library Book isn’t about finding the answer to a mystery – it’s an ode to books, a love-letter to reading and a homage to libraries and their place in the world. It’s a book that’s perfect for anyone who has whiled away hours browsing the stacks or has childhood memories of magical trips to neighbourhood branches. In short, it’s for anyone who appreciates the power of libraries to fascinate, to educate, to entertain and to unite – a rich, warm and heartening book that kept me spellbound throughout.\n\nThe Library Book by Susan Orlean is published by Atlantic Books and is available now from all good bookshops and online retailers including Hive, Waterstones and Amazon.

Then stop wasting food. According to a new report published this month in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, “Wasted Food, Wasted Energy: The Embedded Energy in Food Waste in the United States,” consumers could immediately save the energy equivalent of around 350 million barrels of oil a year though the curbing of food waste. Why? In part because the study estimated that it takes the equivalent of about 1.4 billion barrels of oil to produce, package, prepare, preserve, and distribute a year’s worth of food in the U.S.\n\nAuthors Michael Webber and Amanda Cuéllar note that food contains energy and requires energy to produce, process and transport. As a matter of fact, rising energy costs are the largest contributor to rising food costs. The authors’ estimates indicate that between 8 and 16 percent of energy consumption in the United States went toward food production in 2007. However, it appears that consumers don’t take energy costs into account when eating as the USDA estimates that people in the U.S. waste nearly 27 percent of their food.\n\nThe report also estimated that when accounting for wasted food and the energy needed to ready it for consumption, U.S. consumers wasted about 2030 trillion BTU of energy in 2007, or the equivalent of about 350 million barrels of oil. That represents about 2 percent of annual energy consumption in the U.S. “Consequently, the energy embedded in wasted food represents a substantial target for decreasing energy consumption in the U.S.,” the article states. But the authors note the problem is probably worse because the numbers used were incomplete, outdated and conservative.\n\nThe authors concluded that the energy discarded in wasted food is greater than the energy available from many popular efficiency and energy procurement strategies, such as the annual production of ethanol from grains and annual petroleum available from drilling in the outer continental shelf. “A decrease in food waste must be accompanied with a retooling of the food supply chain to ensure that the energy consumed during food production does in fact decrease with a decrease in food waste.”"}]}, {"type": "interleaved", "items": [{"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00097.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "Microplastic is everywhere and many carry concerns about it.

For example, while the former Soviet Union declared itself a democracy, its elections were not “free and fair”, as only one party with state-approved candidates was represented. The USSR is more correctly classified as a socialist republic.\n\nIn addition, the boundaries between various forms of government can be fluid or poorly defined, often with overlapping characteristics.

This control extends to all political and financial matters as well as the attitudes, morals, and beliefs of the people.\n\nOne distinctive feature of totalitarian governments is the existence of an explicit or implied national ideology—a set of beliefs intended to give meaning and direction to the entire society.\n\nAccording to Russian history expert and author Richard Pipes, Fascist Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini once summarized the basis of totalitarianism as, “Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state.”\n\nExamples of characteristics that might be present in a totalitarian state include:\n\nTypically, the characteristics of a totalitarian state tend to cause people to fear their government. Rather than trying to allay that fear, totalitarian rulers encourage it and use it to ensure the people’s cooperation.\n\nAn authoritarian state is characterized by a strong central government that allows people a limited degree of political freedom. However, the political process, as well as all individual freedom, is controlled by the government without any constitutional accountability\n\nIn 1964, Juan José Linz, Professor Emeritus of Sociology and Political Science at Yale University, described the four most recognizable characteristics of authoritarian states as:\n\nModern dictatorships such as Venezuela under Hugo Chávez and Cuba under Fidel Castro typify authoritarian governments.\n\nWhile the People’s Republic of China under Chairman Mao Zedong was considered a totalitarian state, modern-day China is more accurately described as an authoritarian state because its citizens are now allowed some limited personal freedoms.\n\nIn a totalitarian state, the government’s range of control over the people is virtually unlimited. The government controls nearly all aspects of the economy, politics, culture, and society. Education, religion, the arts and sciences, and even morality and reproductive rights are controlled by totalitarian governments.\n\nWhile all power in an authoritarian government is held by a single dictator or group, the people are allowed a limited degree of political freedom.\n\nRarely employed since the end of World War II in 1945, fascism is a form of government combining the most extreme aspects of both totalitarianism and authoritarianism. Even when compared to extreme nationalistic ideologies like Marxism and anarchism, fascism is typically considered to be at the far-right end of the political spectrum.\n\nFascism is characterized by the imposition of dictatorial power, government control of industry and commerce, and the forcible suppression of opposition, often at the hands of the military or a secret police force. Fascism was first seen in Italy during World War I, later spreading to Germany and other European countries during World War II.\n\nThe Foundations of Fascism\n\nThe foundation of fascism is a combination of ultranationalism—an extreme devotion to one’s nation over all others—along with a widely held belief among the people that the nation must and will be somehow saved or “reborn.” Rather than working for concrete solutions to economic, political, and social problems, fascist rulers divert the peoples’ focus, while winning public support, by elevating the idea of a need for a national rebirth into a virtual religion. To this end, fascists encourage the growth of cults of national unity and racial purity.\n\nHistorically, the primary function of fascist regimes has been to maintain the nation in a constant state of readiness for war. Fascists observed how rapid, mass military mobilizations during World War I blurred the lines between the roles of civilians and combatants. Drawing on those experiences, fascist rulers strive to create a rabidly nationalistic culture of “military citizenship” in which all citizens are willing and prepared to take on some military duties during times of war, including actual combat.\n\nIn addition, fascists view democracy and the electoral process as an obsolete and unnecessary obstacle to maintaining constant military readiness. They also consider a totalitarian, one-party state as the key to preparing the nation for war and its resulting economic and social hardships.\n\nToday, few governments publicly describe themselves as fascist. Instead, the label is more often used pejoratively by those critical of particular governments or leaders. The term “neo-fascist,” for example, describes governments or individuals espousing radical, far-right political ideologies similar to those of the World War II fascist states."}]}, {"type": "interleaved", "items": [{"type": "text", "content": "Former member of the Defence Forces Lisa Smith has been arrested on suspicion of terrorist offences.\n\nThe 38-year-old arrived at Dublin Airport this morning after being deported from Turkey.\n\nShe is being questioned at Kevin Street Garda Station in Dublin.\n\nMs Smith travelled to Syria in 2015 to live in the so-called Islamic State.\n\nTurkish Airlines flight 1975 landed in Dublin Airport just after 10am with Ms Smith and her daughter on board.\n\nThey were accompanied by four escort personnel from the Army Ranger Wing and the Department of Foreign Affairs.\n\nMs Smith and her child were covered with a pink blanket and declined to comment when approached on the flight by RTÉ News, simply responding \"No\".\n\nThe Dundalk woman, who left Ireland four years ago, was deported from Turkey and met by gardaí from the Counter Terrorism Section at Dublin Airport.\n\nThe Garda's Security and Intelligence Section and the Special Detective Unit have been investigating her activities since 2012 and have gathered substantial information and intelligence from Europe, Africa, the Middle East as well as Ireland."}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00107.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "Ms Smith and her daughter were taken to a van and driven to Kevin Street Garda Station arriving just before 11am.\n\nThe 38-year-old was arrested and her child is now being cared for by her family.\n\nShe has been granted access to all medical and legal requirements and is being interviewed about suspected terrorist offences.\n\nIrish Citizens Lisa Smith and her child (2yrs) were today successfully repatriated to Ireland.

In a restaurant, a waiter/waitress plays an essential part in the experience at the restaurant. In Acts 6, the Apostles describe the importance of having men who are servants.\n\nThe church in Jerusalem had grown from just a handful to around 20,000. What happens when things grow fast? It happened right here in Acts, administrative problems begin. There's been a couple of attacks in the early church: persecution and hypocrisy (Ananias and his wife). But now Satan tries something else, division as there was a part of the church that wasn't being cared for properly. The Apostles saw and acknowledge the need and problem. But they faced a problem themselves.\n\nVerse 2 says, \"It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables.\" The apostles know they can't stop doing the very thing that Jesus had given them. Still, they also see people in their care who needed to be physically cared for. This isn't a derogatory comment, \"waiting tables\" was a necessary and honourable task, but one better suited for others. The apostles had been called to prayer and the ministry of the Word.\n\nIn our last post, we looked at the importance of Elders and what they do. Elders shepherd the flock and exercise oversight through the teaching of God's Word and prayer. This is the mechanism that is used to grow the church, not just numerically, but spiritually. To neglect these things would be the same as knocking the legs from underneath you and would be disobedience to what Jesus told the Apostles and all other elders. God uses the hearing of his Word to call, justify, and sanctify his people and to neglect that would be the worst thing you can do to a church seeking to be healthy.\n\nBut when we look at the problem that is being faced here, we see that caring for others is an essential part of being a disciple of Jesus because it reflects the heart of Jesus for others. And the widows of a specific group in the young church wasn't being taken care of. So what is to be done? They looked for men who were an example of godliness to take on the church's mercy project to allow the Apostles to continue on in the preaching of the Bible and pray for the church.\n\nThese men were \"full of the Spirit,\" and I can't emphasize how important this character is in men who want to be deacons. To be full of the Spirit means to be controlled by God's Spirit rather than their own flesh or sinful nature. The apostles didn't take a chance on people of unproven character.  Why does it matter? The church and the gospel receive no advantage from our appointing those not full of the Spirit. Deacons are to be men know to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. These are also wise men, meaning they are men who live by God's precepts and apply them to life's situation. Stephen, in verse 5, was seen as this. He was a man \"full of faith and of the Holy Spirit\" (vs. 5) and \"full of God's grace and power\" (vs. 8). All of these things can only be done through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.\n\nThere's an emphasis on making sure that those in this position are actually those who are growing in Christ. I can't overestimate the importance of the type of person shown here being in Deacon's office. We need to learn how to identify and pray for such people to be strengthened as a church. Deacons are people who are established believers, and in 1 Timothy, there must be a time of testing to make sure \"blameless\" (v. 10). We aren't talking about perfect, but they are not open to misconduct charges. These are people who must be in \"good standing,\" which is talking about those people's spiritual standing in the kingdom of God rather than a step up some kind of ecclesial corporate ladder (v. 13). Finally, \"confidence in the faith\" means that deacons can serve boldly with the assurance that what they do is right when done in accord with the gospel (v. 13).\n\nHere's a question for you: What caused the church to grow to this size? This is a church that had withstood persecution, a scandal, and now is facing division. Was it a program? No. It was the preaching of God's Word in verse 7, and this was able to happen as these seven men faithful served the church, freeing the Apostles to preach and pray.\n\nA few years ago, I was walking with some men who the elders saw as potential elders. They were seen as doing the work of the elder before they held the office of elder. And one of the men said to me, \"I don't know if I am ready to be an Elder, can I just start off with being a deacon?\" My response was that deacons are not a lower stage of becoming an Elder. They are two different offices and with two different roles. It doesn't mean that an Elder won't help bring food over to someone's house just as it means that a deacon won't teach a class, but it does means that they have different roles with different emphasis.\n\nElders and Deacons are needed in the church for health to happen; Church health happens when biblically qualified elders' are dedicated to overseeing the church and who are dedicated to praying and teaching her. That can only happen when Deacons are joyfully serving the church freeing up the Elders to teach God's Word and pray. Deacons don't lead or oversee the church. This is God's role he has given to the elders (see Acts 20:28; 1 Tim. 5:17; 1 Pet. 5:1–2). Instead, they humbly serve the congregation by ensuring practical matters are met. In so doing, they free the pastors from doing these tasks to devote themselves to teaching, praying, and leading. We would do well to appreciate those who hold the office of Deacon, which is often unnoticed and unappreciated. One isn't a stepping stone to another; people's same character is supposed to be in both.\n\nFor example, a deacon may handle benevolence requests so that a pastor can prepare a sermon. A deacon may take care of the church's leaky roof so that the elders can focus on equipping and counselling others. Of course, some overlap may occur, but by and large, deacons handle physical and logistical needs, and elders tend to spiritual matters.\n\nWe might be tempted to think that being a deacon isn't that important. Being an elder or a missionary or a conference speaker or a Christian author is where it's at. But Scripture disagrees. Competent, qualified deacons are essential to the health of a local church. When deacons serve the congregation and support the elders, they protect the church's unity—something Jesus views as precious (see John 17). One reason those first deacons were so important is that they prevented the Jerusalem church from fracturing."}]}, {"type": "interleaved", "items": [{"type": "text", "content": "Every NBA season there are 6 major awards given out to the best player of those respective fields. The awards are the MVP (Most Valuable Player), ROY (Rookie of the Year), DPOY (Defensive Player of the Year), 6MOY (6th Man of the Year), MIP (Most Improved Player) and COY (Coach of the Year). There are 3 candidates for each award every year. Here we will try to predict both the 3 candidates and the winner of all the awards, which will be given out at the NBA Award show on June 25th.\n\nJames Harden has showed all season why he deserves the MVP award. He deserved it last year but with Russell Westbrook's historic season, Harden was an afterthought. Harden currently leads the league in points per game with 30.7 and is 3rd in assists per game with 8.8. His Rockets have already surpassed the 60 win mark and that has been without Chris Paul next to him for almost 15 games this season. Harden has made an extremely strong case for the top award this season.\n\nLeBron is the best basketball player in the world and has been since he entered the league in 2003. Although the Cavaliers have taken a major step back this year both defensively and in the standings, LeBron has continued his strong case for the MVP like he does every single year. Without LeBron, the Cavaliers would most likely not be in a playoff position.\n\nThe Pelicans had a slow start to the season. Then Boogie and the Brow put it together and started winning some big games. Then DeMarcus Cousins went down and was out for the season. Without the Pelicans second superstar, Anthony Davis has picked up his play and led his Pelicans to a high playoff position after many thought the Pelicans were done and out. His MVP-like play has allowed the Pelicans to stay afloat.\n\nRookie of the Year:\n\nAlthough he was drafted with the 2016-17 class, Ben Simmons has showed why he was a number one overall pick. His leadership and playmaking ability has lead the 76ers to an incredible season and has made them get back to the playoffs for the first time in 6 years. His shot is awful but teams still can't find a way to stop him, that's just how good he really is."}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00111.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "Photo: Rookie of the Year Candidate Donovan Mitchell of the Utah Jazz throws shade at Ben Simmons of the 76ers, who is a ROY candidate despite being drafted in 2016\n\nPhoto: Rookie of the Year Candidate Donovan Mitchell of the Utah Jazz throws shade at Ben Simmons of the 76ers, who is a ROY candidate despite being drafted in 2016 Photo courtesy of Sports Canyon.\n\nWhen the Jazz drafted this guy people wondered what kind of impact he would have. At first it didn't seem like he would do much for them. Throughout the season, Mitchell has been the Jazz's most consistent offensive player. Since the all-star break Mitchell lead the Jazz on a 10 game win streak to put them back in playoff contention. Without Mitchell's offense, the Jazz would be completely lost and at the bottom of the barrel in the western conference.\n\nWith the injury of Gordon Hayward on the first game of the season Jayson Tatum has stepped into the role of the Celtics starting small forward. His scoring touch has been extremely consistent all season and he is averaging 14 points this season. He has helped the Celtics cruise into the 2 seed in the eastern conference.\n\nJoel Embiid has been a staple all season in the paint for the Sixers. He has been a menace for opposing teams with his shot blocking and rebounding abilities. Even without practicing with the team he has still fit right in with Brett Brown's system around his teammates.\n\nDrummond has had an incredible bounceback season. He was an all star this season and is leading the league in rebounding with an incredible 16 rebounds per game. He single handedly kept Detroit in the playoff race with no one around him knowing how to play any sort of defense.\n\nThe Jazz have been on a tear since Gobert came back from injury earlier this season. Since he came back the Jazz have been one of the top defensive teams in the NBA and he has been the anchor of it all. His stout inside presence along with his ability to step along the perimeter and defend quicker players has lead the Jazz back into the playoffs for the second straight season.\n\nSixth Man of the Year:\n\nGordon has been just as good this year as he was last year, if not better. He does everything the Rockets ask him to do. He comes into the game and knocks down big shots in the clutchest of moments. He has stayed healthy all year which is Gordon's biggest problem and he has shown how incredible he can be while healthy.\n\nSweet Lou is a professional scorer and that's exactly what he does. He comes into the game to score, score and score some more. His run for the all-star team may have been a little ridiculous but even to think that a bench player could make the team is an incredible feat in itself. He has been the Clippers best player this season coming off the bench.\n\nHis short stint with the Cavaliers was better than people think. Wade may have not defended in the land but he certainly made some highlight plays with LeBron at his side. Once he got back to Miami, Wade really turned it on. He has been their best player since returning home to the Heat coming off the bench behind Tyler Johnson.\n\nNot having John Wall this season was a blessing in disguise for Beal. He became an all-star and started perfecting his scoring touch. Teams could never figure Beal out and still can't seem to defend him. He has not been as afraid to be more aggressive on the offensive end and has gained so much confidence that every time he puts up a shot, you think it's going to go in.\n\nWhen the Pacers traded away Paul George for Domantas Sabonis and Victor Oladipo it seemed as though the Thunder had gotten a complete steal of a trade. As the season rolled on, the tables seemed to turn and it looks now like the Pacers had gotten the steal. Oladipo made his first all-star appearance this season and has lead his Pacers to the 5 seed in the east after many thought they would be sitting at the bottom of the barrel.\n\nAs I said before, Drummond has had a complete bounceback season. He looked slow and ineffective last season and this season, Drummond has been one of the Pistons lone bright spots. He needs help around him to be better than they are right now but he lead the Pistons to 37 wins basically by himself.\n\nCoach of the Year:\n\nThe Rockets are going to finish at least five games ahead of the second place team in the NBA. D'Antoni's fast paced offense has lead this team to the top ranked offense in the NBA along with the 7th placed defense. D'Antoni may have won it last year but you could make the case that his team has been even better than it was last season.\n\nThe amount of injuries the Celtics have endured this season has been brutal. He has still lead them to the 2nd top team in the eastern conference with so many young players. Stevens may be the best coach in the NBA and might still be underrated as a coach.\n\nThe coach of the Pacers came into the season with extremely low expectations as his team gave away their franchise cornerstone in a trade this offseason. He has coached them into the playoffs with incredible talent around him and a much deeper bench than many think."}]}, {"type": "interleaved", "items": [{"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00112.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "Daisuke Moriyama Art Works: Chronicle is the English translated edition of the original Japanese artbook 森山大輔画集 CHRONICLE that was released in 2012.

I had been out the night before (for your reference: https://nobeladventures.com/2019/04/08/my-night-as-a-proper-new-yorker/#more-884 ) and was feeling ever so seedy and very much fatigued.\n\nThe first activity for the morning was a behind the scenes tour of the Gershshwin Theatre, where Wicked is performed. I feigned illness (or perhaps I actually was ill – can’t remember) and weaselled my way out of having to attend that activity. I think I spent the morning writing the blog I linked to above “My Night as a Proper New Yorker”, which has proven to be my most popular blog so far I’d say it was a morning well spent. I can’t comment too much on the tour, as I had declined to go, but the other dance mums gave it very mixed reviews. Those that had seen Wicked LOVED it and those that hadn’t seen Wicked yet said it was “meh” and that “I didn’t miss much”. I have fantastic instincts. Every time I have opted out of a group activity I have been told by that others were jealous that they weren’t as wise as I and also wish they’d ditched.\n\nThe second activity I begrudgingly went along to, for no other reason than to create the illusion that I am a supportive mother who is interested in having shared activities with my children. For the record, I LOVE my children and shared activities. It’s just that there are some activities that I know they will not like (e.g. the previous day’s slow moving bus tour). These activities, disliked by all, end up being unpleasant for all involved AND the second activity on the day’s agenda was ANOTHER BUS TOUR.\n\nMy expectations were immensely low. So low in fact, I’d bought along my kindle so I could read on the bus. The Bus tour we were booked on was called “The Ride” and I knew nothing about it other than that we would be on a bus and driving around New York. After this tour, the kids were going to be performing a flash mob on the streets of NYC somewhere or other and then hustling back to the hotel to get ready to see Aladdin the musical.\n\nThe Ride was SENSATIONAL!! I am happy to report that yet again my instincts (to join this activity) were right on point. The Ride is an interactive bus tour with Stadium style seating facing a huge window on the side of the bus. Rather than the seating facing towards the driver, it looked out on to the street. We had two hosts who must double as comedians as they were hilarious!! Their commentary as we drove around the streets of NYC had us all in stitches. It wasn’t scripted either as they would crack jokes about random things we saw and provide us with information that wasn’t the usual ‘boring’ stuff. There must be an abundance of talented comedians in NYC in order for a bus company to nab two absolutely crackerjack artists.\n\nIn between the comical play-by-play on the happenings of the streets of NY we were surprised when many seemingly ordinary NY-ers burst into a street performance for our entertainment and pleasure. We had a ballerina, a rapper, musicians, dancers… and I’m sure many more performances that I have since forgotten as I’m so far behind in my blog. All in all, if you are going to do any bus tour of NY – DO THIS ONE!! They offer a few different themed tours and I would have liked to have tried the others. I will have to save doing them for when I move to NY to pursue my writing/acting-as-a-cadaver career.\n\nThe Ride we went on was called the Entertainment Ride and google informs me it usually costs $69p/p for 90 minutes. Google also informed me that you can sometimes get tickets on Groupon. Our tickets were purchased as a group and were part of our package so I have no idea what they cost. Information on the ride can be found here: https://experiencetheride.com/sightseeing-attractions/the-ridenyc/\n\nAfter exiting the ride our group prepared for our flashmob, which ended up being a performance for the next lot of spectators who were on The Ride. Kids absolutely killed it and performed like true professionals.\n\nThe flashmob was followed by a frantic walk back to the hotel in amongst the million other people in Times Square walking frantically to somewhere very important, a quick change into our finest outfits and a bite to eat before another frantic walk back to a theatre to see Aladdin.\n\nI have already seen Aladdin and generally, I only like to see things once but this was my first Broadway show so I tried my best to get excited. Kids all looked so nice dressed up and Isabelle was ecstatic. She was so thrilled in fact that the lady serving drinks in the foyer gave her a free drink and cup. I bought the girls a lollipop to keep them from moaning about hunger pains during the show (they didn’t really have much dinner) and lollipops looked to be the cheapest menu item that would last the longest time. SIX DOLLARS is what a lollipop at Aladdin costs. That is USD too!!! I did my best to breezily pass over my credit card to the girl like paying $18USD for 3 lollipops was the most natural, normal thing I have ever done. This is the same girl who had given Isabelle a free cup and bottle of water (valued at $15) so I just pretended I was paying for that instead.\n\nI spent the entire time, while watching Aladdin, comparing the Broadway version to the version I saw in Southbank (Brisvegas). The genie was the same in both shows and absolutely stole the show. I don’t think there was anyone else in it but him. Just kidding. Aladdin was also brilliant and I’m not just saying that because he is an Aussie. I’m also saying it because he is really, really hot. Although I did wonder if his abs were real or painted on with contouring makeup??? One thing that the Australian version did waaay better than the Broadway one was the sets. I have it on good authority that the sets in both shows are identical but if my memory serves me right (and it very often serves me wrong – so who can tell??) the set of the Aussie Aladdin was shinier, brighter and more captivating than the Broadway set. Seeing Aladdin on Broadway was no different to seeing it in Brisvegas (for my US reader Brisvegas is a slang term for Brisbane). But I was glad to lose my Broadway virginity. I now feel more cultured and can throw around sentences like “when I saw such&such on Broadway…….” when in conversation with uppity people.\n\nGeez… all this harping on about missing Rohan is doing nothing to shorten the length of my blogs.\n\nThanks for reading.

The Glock 48 and 42 both received a few votes.\n\nSmith & Wesson carry guns were mentioned slightly less often than the first two manufacturers. The S&W Shield got the most votes, which includes the increasingly popular EZ (9mm and .380). There were a few votes for revolvers, and Smith & Wesson dominated the responses in that category.\n\nSpringfield Armory has recently upped their concealed carry guns game, and it shows in our results. Coming in strong was their new Hellcat, followed by a few votes for the EMP 9mm. Surprisingly, there were no votes for their XD models.\n\nFalling out of favor with concealed carriers, but still in the mix was the LCP (both 9mm and .380). The LCR revolver was mentioned just a few times.\n\nKimber had a small showing but did (just barely) make the list. Their 1911's came in first, followed by the Micro 9.\n\nTaurus has recently made a commitment to improving their quality, and a few of their concealed carry gun models have been gaining traction as a response.

According to the plaintiff, who hails from West Hollywood, there is nothing in the explanation of benefits for her policy that suggests Anthem has the right to withhold a treatment option due to the expense. Rather, the Harvoni lawsuit holds that Anthem simply requires that a drug be medically accepted and approved, and not costlier than comparable drugs.\n\nWhich it isn’t, because there is really nothing comparable. Harvoni was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in mid-October of last year, and held so much promise that doctors began prescribing Harvoni to their patients almost immediately. The developer and manufacturer of Harvoni, Gilead Sciences Inc. (Gilead), achieved sales of more than $2 billion for 2014, in a little more than 10 weeks.\n\nThere is no question Harvoni is expensive, at about $1,000 per pill or just under $100,000 for a 12-week treatment program. Harvoni is an advanced version of Gilead’s Sovaldi, which is also expensive, but also highly effective.\n\nInsurers have been concerned that such expensive drugs, with no alternatives, could succeed in driving up the cost of premiums.\n\nHowever, that is not the concern of the plaintiff, who maintains Anthem should honor the various clauses and commitments in the insurance policy of approving and undertaking a treatment option provided the treatment is medically accepted. Whether or not Harvoni is costlier than it needs to be is of no concern to the plaintiff.\n\nMore HARVONI DENIED CLAIM News\nAnthem, the complaint says,\n“applied a more restrictive test...in an effort to increase company profits by limiting the number of patients who would qualify for this life-saving medication.”\n\nThe denial letter that Anthem sent to Andre “does not cite to any provision of the [explanation of benefits] in support of this standard,” according to the Gilead Hep C Denied Insurance Claim Lawsuit.\n\nPlaintiff Andre also asserts in her California state Harvoni lawsuit that physicians employed by Anthem to review her appeals lacked expertise in treating Hep C. Her lawsuit suggests that Anthem has decided to restrict treatment with Harvoni in patients with advanced liver scarring from Hep C.\n\nThe case is Andre v.

The biggest jump is seen in “government-guaranteed bank bonds” due to an Italian decree issued December 6 (described in this speech by the Gov. of the Bank of Italy, P.11) which allowed banks to issue government backed bonds in return for a fee to the Italian government.  These bonds, which by virtue of the government guarantee were instantly available for financing at the Bank of Italy, represented 77 billion in credit extended by March 2012.  On the other hand, the extension of credit claims represented little additional credit by March; according to the Bank only 4 billion had been extended against whole loans made eligible by the ECB and Bank of Italy’s decision allowing for lowerquality assets to be posted as collateral increasing the total amount of whole loands posted to 54 billion (net of haircuts).\n\nThe increase in government securities posted could be caused by several things.

He said actionable forensic evidence has been shared with the Iranian government showing links of the terrorists with the neighbouring country, besides presence of their logistics and training camps located across the border. “We expect Iran to take visible action against the elements who used its soil to carry out Thursday’s terrorist attack in Balochistan,” he said, and added that Afghanistan should also take action against anti-Pakistan elements operating from its soil.\n\nAt least 14 passengers were picked out with the help of their national identity cards (NICs), forcibly offloaded from their bus and then shot dead by unidentified assailants on the Makran Coastal Highway in Ormara, Balochistan, on Thursday. The victims comprised 10 soldiers of Pakistan Navy, three of Pakistan Air Force and a coastguard.\n\nQureshi said the Baloch Raaji-Aajohi-e-Sangar (BRAS), an alliance of three Baloch terrorist organisdations, has claimed responsibility for the incident in which the killers were clad in Frontier Corps (FC) uniforms. The Baloch terrorist outfits have set up their logistic camps inside the Iranian border area and it has also been conveyed to the Iranian authorities, he said.\n\nQureshi said Pakistan wants to know the factors behind the Omara incident. He said Pakistan and Iran enjoy fraternal ties and hoped that Tehran will act against the perpetrators of the incident as assured by his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif in a detailed telephonic conversation with him.\n\nQureshi said considering the prevailing security situation, Pakistan has decided to take six security measures to avoid recurrence of cross-border terrorism. He said a special command based in Balochistan’s Turbat area has been set up, besides raising a new corps to increase border patrolling. It has also been decided that aerial surveillance of the Pak-Iran border will be done through helicopters, he added.\n\nLike Afghanistan, he said, the Iranian border will also be fenced.

The action was accordingly taken and nine out of 12 abducted Iranian personnel were rescued by the Pakistani forces, he said, and added that Prime Minister Imran Khan is scheduled to visit Iran on Sunday during which security issues will be discussed in detail.\n\nResponding to a question, he said the timing of Omara incident is important which shows that the elements behind it do not want peace in the region. He said Pakistan and Iran have historical relationship. Pakistan can overcome its energy crisis by buying gas from Iran but international sanctions against the latter are impeding the process, he added. To another question, he said it is a known fact as to which country is backing such terrorist organisations and supplying weapons to carry out insurgency and bring instability in Pakistan. He said despite worsening human rights situation in the Indian-held Kashmir, Pakistan intends to normalise its relations with India.\n\nEarlier in the day, Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a strong protest with Iran regarding its ‘inaction’ against terror groups believed to be involved in the Ormara massacre.\n\nIn a letter written to the Iranian embassy on Friday, the foreign ministry stated, “Killing of 14 innocent Pakistanis by terrorist groups based in Iran is a very serious incident that Pakistan protests strongly.”\n\nAs per a copy of the letter available with Daily Times, “15-20 terrorists camouflaged themselves in Frontier Corps (FC) uniform, barricaded the road and stopped 3-4 buses travelling from Ormara to Gwadar on the coastal highway at Buzi Top before dawn on April 18. On the identification of the passengers, 14 personnel belonging to the armed forces were shot dead.” According to the letter, ‘BRAS’, an alliance of three Baloch terrorist organisations, has claimed responsibility for the terrorist act. Following the incident, the terrorists, who had arrived from the border region, returned to that area, the letter claimed.\n\nThe ministry stated that Pakistan has ‘repeatedly’ shared intelligence about these activities. “In the recent past as well as on numerous occasions earlier, information about the hubs of these Baloch terrorist organisations in Iran having training camps and logistics bases across the border was shared with the Iranian intelligence. Unfortunately, no action has been taken by Iran in this regard, to date,” the letter stated.\n\nWhile lodging Pakistan’s protest against the deaths in Ormara, the letter said that Pakistan is awaiting Iran’s response to its ‘request for action against these groups based in Iran, whose locations have been identified by Pakistan a number of times.’\n\nThe ministry called on the embassy to convey the concerns to the relevant authorities in Iran for ‘prompt action’.\n\n“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the esteemed embassy the assurances of its highest consideration,” the letter concluded.\n\nA day earlier, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif had condemned the Ormara attack. “Strongly condemning the recent terrorist attack in Pakistan, just as PM Imran Khan embarks on his first, historic visit to Iran,” Zarif had tweeted. “Terrorists, extremists & their sponsors are terrified by close relations between Muslim states,” he continued. “Iran stands with the people and government of Pakistan,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Ormara Levies registered a first information report in connection with the incident. A Levies officer, who wished not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said that an FIR has been lodged against unidentified terrorists for the murder of 14 people on April 18. The case has been registered on behalf of the government, the officer said. Terrorism, murder, attempt to murder and other sections have been included in the report, he added.\n\nLevies officials said security has been beefed up in the area and passenger buses are being strictly checked in the aftermath of the cold-blooded murders.

The following year, Andrew and Anne Eberstadt donated an adjacent 1-acre parcel of woodlands, bringing the total acreage up to 5.5 acres. The original appraisal describes the land as “…most attractive, being mostly open level field ringed by mature trees to the east and south. To the west and north is an exceptionally well-finished stone wall which appears to have been built more recently than most in the area. In fact, the beauty of this parcel has long been a topic of conversation with local people, particularly because of its high visibility.”\n\nThe wall was indeed built, or at least re-built, more recently than most. According to Kenneth Hannan, the land donor, the wall was constructed by Antonio Vitti over the years 1933-1940. Vitti had worked for the family of Gesine Engel, who owned the field at the time, after he had returned from WWI in 1919. There is a commemorative stone at the northeast corner of the wall describing the work. Today, the wall makes a 900-foot arc around the edge of the field.

This continued care is needed to maintain a diverse array of grasses and wildflowers, and to prevent woody plants and trees from taking over the field. In 2019, NCLT pruned nearly all of the perimeter trees, and removed dozens of invasive bushes from the edge of the field. This project restored the field to its original area, and will help to support an even larger population of pollinators and migratory birds.

A guide to vegan lattes in Taipei\n\nby Amelia Easten\nin All Things Vegan, Food and Restaurants, Taiwan"}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00157.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "I’m a coffee shop dweller. Alcohol could disappear off the face of the earth tomorrow and I wouldn’t care (I might even rejoice) but if coffee disappeared… I’d be a little sad. More specifically, I like a really good latte, because sometimes black coffee just doesn’t cut it. I can count the number I’ve had in the last 8 months on one hand.\n\nThis surprised me – it’s not something I expected from Asia. I grew up being told that in general Asians are lactose intolerant and therefore not much milk is drunk here. Taiwan is part of the ‘non-milking zone,’ countries that traditionally do not consume animal milk or dairy products, despite plenty of cows, buffaloes, and goats. The non-milking zone covers all of Southeast Asia from Burma eastwards including China, Korea, and Japan. The zone ends with the dairy-consuming Mongols to the north and the Tibetans and Indians to the west. Some 85% of the people in the non-milking zone above the age of three years have low levels of the intestinal enzyme lactase that breaks down the lactose in animal milks. This is not exclusive to East Asia: some 60% of the Western world are also lactose intolerant, and this percentage rises when people stop consuming dairy and the body is given a chance to wean. It is not just humans who cannot digest lactose, the condition is also prevalent in other land mammals (cats, for instance). An inability to digest lactose is more common than not: animal milk is intended for baby animals only, to assist growth in the early years of life. Beyond then it is not designed for continued consumption.\n\nIn fact, I heard somewhere that Westerners smell like milk because so little in drunk in Asia. The irony? The children I work with drink so much milk, they smell milky to me – I haven’t touched dairy in two and a half years. The dairy industry has got it’s claws into Taiwan, and it’s not letting go.\n\n“But soy is everywhere!” I hear you cry. Soy oil for cooking, soy based ink on packaging, soy desserts, tofu in everything, soy sauce, soy milk from the breakfast bars. So why in stinky tofu’s name can’t I get a soy latte when I walk into a coffee shop? I think my (also vegan) friend hit the nail on the head when she described the attitude difference towards soy milk in the East vs. the West. She told me “they think of it as a juice, not a milk, and drink it like they’d drink orange juice. Why would you put orange juice in your tea?”\n\nThis is shown in the language, too. Cow’s milk is 牛奶 niu2nai3, literally ‘cow milk’. To ask for soy milk, the character is 豆漿 Dou4jiang1. Dou4 means bean, usually soy bean, and jiang1 is a thick liquid. Doujiang is first referenced in China in A.D. 82 in the Lun Heng by Wang Ch’ung, although this may be the thicker liquid version, before it was strained into a milk like consistency. (Read more on the history of soy milk here, it’s pretty interesting.) For decades in Taiwan it has been a common as a breakfast food, and large pots are often seen outside breakfast shops. In the 1960s and 1970s it started becoming popular as a soft drink. In 7/11s today you can find bottles of sweetened soy milk with flavours like chocolate and red bean. The problem is… Most have regular milk in them, too.\n\nLike in China, soy milk is drunk as the soft drink of choice in Taiwan. In most small restaurants, for instance, only soy milk is offered in the fridges. In China this has phenomenon has socialist roots. The Asian Wall Street Journal (14 June 1983) published a front page article blasting Coca Cola, which was growing in popularity, for being unhealthy and filled with sugar, caffeine and phosphoric acid. It was also far more expensive than soy milk, and cutting the amount they imported in favour of locally produced soy milk boosted China’s economy.\n\nAlmond milk is popular in Taiwan too, usually in powdered form. Walk through any nightmarket and you’ll soon find the sickly sweet smell. However, almond milk in Taiwan 90% of the time also contains milk powder – that or you’ll be paying through the nose for it. I can only assume this is to both lower the cost, and given it a creamier consistency. The moral of the story is beware: if you’re buying soy milk somewhere in Asia, check first that it’s not got cow juice lurking in its depths. To ask – “you3 niu2nai3 ma?” listen for the reply – “you3” (has) or “mei3 you3” (doesn’t have).\n\nSo where can I get a coffee?\n\nI used to avoid Starbucks in the UK, but they’re everywhere here, the staff are friendly, and the soy milk is the same as I use at home – so vegan safe. The coffees aren’t the best, and they’re certainly not healthy, but it’s somewhere to sit and have a coffee when I’m on my lunch break. If you don’t feel like coffee, their matcha green tea latte is creamy and delicious. Warning: caramel macchiato isn’t vegan (milk in the drizzle), neither is their hot chocolate (sob, it used to be) nor their chai tea latte (honey in the syrup)."}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00158.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "Hazelnut Macchiato, my usual on days I need a kick.\n\nThey don’t do lattes, but they do white coffee with a coconut almond milk blend that is delicious.

Why?\n\nPeople will store their minds on the computers in the future\n\nWe have our limits as humans\n\nListening about the future exercises\n\nListen. Does the futurologist think these things are probable or not probable?\n\nComplete the sentences with your ideas:\n\nWould you like to know what’s in our future? What’s going to happen tomorrow, next year, or even a millennium from now? Well, you’re not alone. Everyone from governments to militaries\nto industry leaders do, as well, and they all employ people called futurists who attempt to forecast the future. Some are able to do this with surprising accuracy. In the middle of the 20th century, a think tank known as the RAND Corporation consulted dozens of scientists\nand futurists who together forecast many of the technologies we take for granted today, including artificial organs, the use of birth control pills, and libraries able to look up\nresearch material for the reader.\n\nOne way futurists arrive at their predictions is by analyzing movements and trends in society, and charting the paths they are likely to follow into the future with varying degrees of probability. Their work informs the decisions of policymakers and world leaders, enabling them to weigh options for the future that otherwise could not have been imagined in such depth or detail. Of course, there are obvious limits to how certain anyone can be about the future.\n\nThere are always unimaginable discoveries that arise which would make no sense to anyone in the present. Imagine, for example, transporting a physicist from the middle of the 19th century into the 21st. You explain to him that a strange material exists, Uranium 235, that of its own accord can produce enough energy to power an entire city, or destroy it one fell swoop. “How can such energy come from nowhere?” he would demand to know. “That’s not science, that’s magic.” And for all intents and purposes, he would be right. His 19th century grasp of science includes no knowledge of radioactivity or nuclear physics. In his day, no forecast of the future could have predicted X-rays, or the atom bomb, let alone the theory of relativity or quantum mechanics. As Arthur C. Clarke has said, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” How can we prepare, then, for a future that will be as magical to us as our present would appear to someone from the 19th century?\n\nWe may think our modern technology and advanced data analysis techniques might allow us to predict the future with much more accuracy than our 19th century counterpart, and rightly so. However, it’s also true that our technological progress has brought with it new increasingly complex and unpredictable challenges. The stakes for future generations to be able to imagine the unimaginable are higher than ever before. So the question remains: how do we do that? One promising answer has actually been with us since the 19th century and the Industrial Revolution that laid the foundation for our modern world. During this time of explosive development and invention, a new form of literature, science fiction, also emerged. Inspired by the innovations of the day, Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and other prolific thinkers explored fantastic scenarios, depicting new frontiers of human endeavor. And throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, storytellers have continued to share their visions of the future and correctly predicted many aspects of the world we inhabit decades later. In “Brave New World,” Aldous Huxley foretold the use of antidepressants in 1932, long before such medication became popular. In 1953, Ray Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451,” forecast earbuds, “thimble radios,” in his words. And in “2001: A Space Odyssey,” Arthur C. Clarke described a portable, flat-screen news pad in 1968. In works that often combine entertainment and social commentary, we are invited to suspend our disbelief and consider the consequences of radical shifts in familiar and deeply engrained institutions. In this sense, the best science fiction fulfills the words of philosopher Michel Foucault, “I’m no prophet. My job is making windows where there were once walls.” Free from the constraints of the present and our assumptions of what’s impossible, science fiction serves as a useful tool for thinking outside of the box. Many futurists recognize this, and some are beginning to employ science fictions writers in their teams.\n\nJust recently, a project called iKnow proposed scenarios that look much like science fiction stories. They include the discovery of an alien civilization, development of a way for humans and animals to communicate flawlessly, and radical life extension. So, what does the future hold? Of course, we can’t know for certain, but science fiction shows us many possibilities. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to determine which we will work towards making a reality."}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00162.png"}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00163.png"}, {"type": "text", "content": "Study with a podcast"}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00164.png"}]}, {"type": "interleaved", "items": [{"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00165.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "A question that sparks curiosity when thinking about the place of COVID19 in China Africa relations is what might the lingering/long-term effects of the pandemic on the perceptions of China among Africans be. After giving it some thought, these are the main points that stand out to me.\n\nCCP’s governance model and strong leadership on display. The CCP’s strong measures to restrict travel, minimize the impact of the outbreak, and prioritize health over economic growth will likely come back and be used in China’s rhetoric showing leadership strengths. Already there is an effort by the government to boast about the its capability to build hospitals in a record time. Certainly, once the outbreak is over (or least contained), we expect to see more assertiveness in marketing China’s governance model as evidenced in its reaction to COVID19.\n\nFriendship and solidarity. In his keynote speech on China’s foreign policy at Chatham House, Chinese ambassador Liu Xiaoming repeatedly condemned racist and exclusionary reactions to COVID19. He stated that the right choice is “to pull together in the same direction” and treat the virus as the common enemy instead of talking about China as “the sick man of Asia.” We have long observed this pattern of rhetoric in China-Africa relations with China always working hard to distance itself from the “West” and identify with Africans as a fellow Global South states. Coronavirus adds a new opportunity to cement this divide and deepen friendship and solidarity bonds between China and African states.\n\nAcross Africa, we saw a wide social media campaign expressing solidarity with Wuhan and China more broadly. Students of Confucius Institutes, diplomats, embassy staff, business people from across the continent, and even parents of students who are stuck in China showed their support.\n\nBut COVID19 is not all good news for China-Africa relations. First, the many and enduring struggles of African students quarantined or stuck in China since the start of the outbreak of the Coronavirus have been well-documented. It is not hard to imagine that the suffering from such terrible experiences might result in many African students not wanting to study in China anymore. The stories that these students are sharing everyday with their friends and family back home describing life under quarantine might not exactly be soft power generating stories for China.\n\nSecond, we recall how the CCP repeatedly argued that the financial crisis of 2008 and its rippling effects on African economies meant that the Western model let Africans down and that there was a need to bring something new to the table (i.e. the Chinese alternative model). Now, we would be remiss not to wonder what’s in the future of Africa-China relations with COVID19 potentially causing a global economic crisis the depth of which is yet to be grasped? One thing that is certain is that the Chinese government is handling this crisis with what it knows to do best: putting personal connections and people-to-people relations at the center of this. We see Chinese diplomats holding forums with parents of students, talking to AU CDC, health ministers, holding press conferences to discuss reactions, providing financial aid to African students quarantined in China, etc.\n\nChances are, as soon as Chinese factories are fully back up to speed with manufacturing masks, gloves, wipes, and other products necessary to handling COVID19, the CCP will capitalize on its production capacity. Both to make the case about its manufacturing strengths and also to gain leadership points for distributing products to areas in need. Countries that expressed solidarity with China in times of need will likely stand to be first to be compensated with a return in favor and solidarity from the Chinese government."}]}, {"type": "interleaved", "items": [{"type": "text", "content": "Centre College women’s soccer moves on to second round"}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00166.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "Matt Overing/matthew.overing@amnews.com Centre's Alana Hughes heads in Centre's second goal of the game off of a cross from Amber Cowell in the second half of Saturday's game against Piedmont.\n\nIt took some time for Centre College to settle in, but the women’s soccer team came through in a big way in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, beating Piedmont 4-1 behind three second-half goals.\n\nThe Colonels beat Piedmont 1-0 earlier in the season, so coach Jay Hoffman knew it would be a challenging game. Playing without All-American and leading scorer Destinie Graves increased the difficulty, but Centre’s depth showed in its dominating display.\n\n“Sometimes when you don’t have a player, other players have to step up and we have to do the little things,” Hoffman said. “I thought the team did a very good job again today of doing the little things, especially in the second half.”\n\nBoth teams struggled to get anything going in the first half, although Centre had a majority of the chances. The Colonels struck first on a headed corner from Alana Hughes to Hannah Sirkin. Just 12 seconds later, Cassidy Reich scored for Piedmont to tie the game at 1-1.\n\n“In the first 20 minutes, both teams are trying to sort out the style,” Hoffman said. “They were pressuring us and we had to be better on the ball, our passes had to be sharper and they weren’t as good as I wanted them to be.”\n\nThe teams were knotted 1-1 at the break, even though Centre held a 12-2 advantage in shots at halftime.\n\nIn the second half, Hoffman’s team burst out of the gate. Shannon Murray headed in a cross from Amber Cowell to give the Colonels a 2-1 lead, and they didn’t look back. Twelve minutes later, Hughes got a goal of her own, blasting a shot into the roof of the net on another Cowell cross.\n\nThroughout the second half, Hoffman was switching his players. With a two-goal lead, nearly all of Centre’s starters were out of the game.\n\n“We made a lot of rotations,” he said. “I wanted to trust our players and give rotations because I looked at today, it’s not just a one game, it’s a two game weekend. If you can get minutes off of your top players, players off of the bench come in and do good work, that should put us in a good situation for having fresh legs tomorrow.”\n\nHoffman’s trust paid off, and his bench continued to deliver. Keeghan Francis scored in the 81st minute to put the game on ice, 4-1.\n\n“You’ve got to trust your players,” Hoffman said. “Nobody really sees how they do in practice, but you’ve got to understand, we’ve been going with our top group with our next group for weeks, and our next group is very, very talented.

But this is not the case at all. The tax due would be reduced significantly as calculated in the three stages below:\n\nMr Expat would be taxed €1,980 in a non-compliant investment even if no withdrawals had been made, whereas in a Spanish tax compliant bond he would only have a tax bill of €172.71 even when taking the full €10,000 and zero if no withdrawal was made.

With only two main controls, output gain and gain reduction (threshold), things couldn’t get much easier. However, if you care to delve a bit deeper into the operation of an opto compressor, things become more interesting and the compressors can be that much more effective. This discussion mainly pertains to plugin models of opto compressors, but much of this discussion can be extended back to using the physical hardware. Hardware units may require a screwdriver to get into some of these options, but many newer hardware units provide more user-friendly access to these parameters.\n\nWhat and Why Opto?\n\nOptical compressors date back to the 1950s when Telektronix (which eventually became part of Universal Audio) debuted the LA-1 compressor. By the mid-1960s the LA-1 developed into the current LA-2A compressor design— which has become a staple both as recording hardware and DAW-based software. Universal Audio manufacturers an extremely popular hardware reissue of the original LA-2A to this day.\n\nThe magic of the LA-2A, and every other optical compressor that followed lies in an optical circuit that acts as the level control, or attenuator. In effect, the audio signal lights a small light panel and a nearby photoresistor senses the light and controls the behavior of the gain reduction. The compressor then adds make-up gain with a tube amplifier (LA-2A) or a solid-state amplifier (LA-3A).\n\nThe user-adjustable parameters of an opto compressor are output gain and gain reduction (threshold). The fixed attack is fast, while the fixed release happens in two stages as described above, and would be generally characterized as slow. The LA-2A provides two modes: compress (3:1) and limit (100:1). Remember that the frequency-dependent nature of the opto blurs these parameters a bit—in a musically helpful way. Most digital models of the LA-2A and LA-3A provide an emphasis control (sometimes labeled pre-emphasis) that often looks like a slotted screw. This screw exists on the original hardware units (sometimes on the rear panel) and was factory set and perhaps adjusted by a studio tech to suit the studio’s preferences. The emphasis control was designed to provide radio stations with better control over the broadcast signal’s high-frequency content.\n\nOptical compressors may contain tubes and transformers, or they may be solid-state and even transformerless. Their compression behavior remains natural and smooth regardless of a tube or solid-state engine, and the distortion and sonic color of a specific opto compressor relate to the amplifier circuitry, not the compression action. Many companies besides Universal Audio produce optical compressors and each design may use a slightly different opto device, so their attack and release times may differ, or even be user-selectable. As optos age, they become weaker, so after only a few years, the performance of an opto compressor may suffer until the opto module is replaced. The LA2A and many other opto compressors use a plugin-in opto module referred to as a T4, which are readily available from a few manufacturers for around USD 100.\n\nI find opto compressors extremely useful for tracking vocals and acoustic instruments. It’s almost impossible to ruin a take with an opto compressor and between the tube (LA-2A) and solid-state (LA-3A) versions, you can capture a clean or harmonically rich track. When mixing, it really helps to delve deeper than simply adjusting the gain reduction and output knobs, so you can dial in precise variations of compression to fit the track you’re working on.\n\nMany engineers swear by using an opto and a FET or VCA compressor in series, but before you get into that, spend some time learning to dial in the opto. Let’s get into the gritty details of the Universal LA-2A and LA-3A. Then I’ll provide a list of other optical compressors that provide similar compression with more or less character. Every DAW provides a stock opto compressor, so you won’t even have to purchase anything to get into these comps.\n\nMore Parameters than Meets the Eye\n\nThe basic parameters of an opto compressor are output gain and gain reduction (threshold). The attack is more or less fixed at around 10 microseconds, while the release happens in two stages as described above, and would be generally characterized as slow. The LA-2A provides two modes: compress (3:1) and limit (100:1). Remember that the frequency-dependent nature of the opto blurs these parameters a bit—in a musically helpful way. Most digital models of the LA-2A and LA-3A provide an emphasis control (sometimes labeled pre-emphasis) that often looks like a flat-head screw. This screw exists on the original hardware units (sometimes on the rear panel) and was factory set and perhaps adjusted by a studio tech to suit the studio’s preferences. The emphasis control was designed to provide radio stations with better control over the broadcast signal’s high-frequency content.\n\nFor most vocals, only 2 or 3dB of compression will hold a vocal still in a mix, but often a few more dB of compression sounds fine. If I find that the vocal still moves around too much, I’ll switch from the compression mode to the limit mode, which provides a bit stiffer control. For upright and electric bass, I often use much more extreme amounts of compression and word has it that Elton John’s shimmering piano sound relies on about 10dB of compression from a pair of LA-2A compressors.\n\nLA-2As produce a bit of mid and low-frequency harmonics, while the LA-3A provides some brighter harmonics, so you may find that different sources are well served by either device. Bob Clearmountain has been known to favor LA3As for vocals for many decades. Plugins emulate hardware to some extent, and each plugin version imparts its own character. I find many plugin optical compressors useful for mixing, and I really only use hardware optical compressors (or any hardware compressors) during tracking sessions.\n\nHere is a list of some excellent plugin optical compressors:\n\nHere are some excellent hardware optical compressors that are still in production today:\n\nContinue learning by reading our other tips and tricks here."}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00181.png"}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00182.png"}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00183.png"}]}, {"type": "interleaved", "items": [{"type": "text", "content": "Dragons have a PR problem, and this movie doesn't help."}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00184.jpeg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "Paramount Home Video, $19.99 In days of old when knights were nowhere near the landscape, dragons and wizards ruled. That's the premise of the 1981 live-action drama Dragonslayer, an engaging but unsatisfying joust with the past from Matthew Robbins, whose short-lived career included Corvette Summer and *batteries not included. Dragonslayer doesn't just lag, it lumbers along, wounded by a tedious script and slow pacing. There are no extras, no commentary, no outtakes, nothing to improve it. And that's a shame, because it is well cast, with Ralph Richardson chewing the scenery as the sorceror Ulrich and Peter MacNicol, recently seen as quirky attorney John Cage on Ally McBeal, as his apprentice, Galen. Galen sets out to destroy the dragon with the cross-dressing virgin (natch) Valerian (Caitlin Clarke), played to perfection in nontypical heroine form. Add the wickedly handsome John Hallam gloriously cast as the evil Tyrian, the king's henchman involved with some hanky panky in the choosing of virgins to slaughter, and so goes the story. But if you can dismiss the uneven scripting, the dragon is the real payoff. Though it is awkward in close-up, where the stop animation is obvious, the overall affect is astonishing. Writhing and glittering beasts, the creatures rear up and breathe hellfire with blazing, believable effect, and a scene of dragonlets munching on the brave sacrificed princess Elspeth (Chloe Salaman) still induces queasiness. Dragons are tough business, cinematically. They're sort of the opposite of unicorns on the good guy-bad guy scale, and they have a serious PR problem. Dragonslayer doesn't help, as these dragons are not just monstrous fire-breathing critters -- they also breed, get in bad moods, and carry grudges. In fact, they'd probably have a good legal case against Hollywood with this movie as a prime suspect. If they're smart, they'll contact the Dragon Union and ask John Cage to represent them."}]}, {"type": "interleaved", "items": [{"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00185.jpg"}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00186.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "Wylie's Kyle Morris (6) heads the ball out of the box during the 2-0 win against Amarillo Tascosa on Friday, Feb. 2, 2018 at Bulldog Stadium.

During the nineteenth century, it was politics that was the major factor of emigration: the failure of the 1848 revolution in Europe, the discrimination against Jews in many of the German principalities, and military conscription. By 1914, seven million Germans had left for the United States.\n\nThe author follows this chronology, including the history of German-speaking immigration after World Wars I and II, but he has also chapters that transcend the chronology, such as German perceptions of Americans and [End Page 182] vice versa, immigrants and slavery, contact with other ethnic groups, and the growth and decline of the German language in the United States. A special chapter is devoted to the situation of German Jewish immigrants during the nineteenth century, but there is none for the twentieth century. The mass exodus of 150,000 German-speaking Jews due to Nazi persecution is presented under the chapter heading of \"The American Exile.\" This title is misleading because they were immigrants and not exiles who wanted to return to Germany after World War II.\n\nThe best chapters are on the early immigration, while the modern period shows some omissions and basic misunderstandings. The attraction of Hollywood before 1933 that brought Marlene Dietrich, Vicki Baum, and William Dieterle to California is not mentioned. Thomas Mann was not a representative of the \"other Germany,\" but insisted on the identity of the good and evil Germany in his speech on \"Germany and the Germans\" of 1945. And it was not Schoenberg's employment by the University of California, Los Angeles that \"saved\" him from selling out to Hollywood, but a missed opportunity, when the composer requested absolute control over the score for the movie \"The Good Earth.\" The deportation of Japanese Americans on the West Coast into relocation camps was based on an executive order by President Roosevelt in 1942 and had nothing to do with the arrest of pro-Nazi sympathizers by the FBI and the Justice Department. Germans and Italians on the West Coast were exempted from the regulations of the executive order, but were subject to a curfew and travel restrictions.\n\nOne of the problems not addressed is the fact that there were a great number of German-speaking immigrants from states that were established after 1918, such as Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. Writers, actors, scriptwriters, directors, and producers, such as Fritz Lang, Peter Lorre, Salka Viertel, Franz Werfel, Billy Wilder, and Otto Preminger, came from these countries but were representatives of Weimar culture,.\n\nAs a final aspect the issue of the German-speaking immigrants as an \"invisible minority\" is discussed. The author traces their desire for accelerated integration to their status as former enemies of both World Wars and to their affinity to the Protestant work ethic of their American neighbors. The Holocaust is another factor that should have been considered.\n\nThere are eighteen short biographies of immigrants included, among them those of Wernher von Braun and Henry Kissinger, who make an odd..."}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00200.jpg"}]}, {"type": "interleaved", "items": [{"type": "text", "content": "TAMPA – Florida FCCLA’s own Jorge Sanchez from Tampa, Florida (District VI, Region III) was elected to serve as the National Vice President of Finance on the 2022-2023 National Executive Council.\n\nJoined by nine other student leaders from across the nation, Jorge will serve the National Organization by serving on the National Board of Directors and the Finance Committee.

Ignoring the other parties at the moment, Labour red only appears in small packets, around London, South Wales, the M62 corridor and the North East.\n\nWe know however that this does not reflect the actual result where the Conservative Party ended up with just under half of the parliamentary seats.

And although she really didn’t like this one, that grey weather and those Frozen people that inhabited it really put a damper on her spirits, on one of her wanderings she found a friend.\n\nShe found White Tiger that day where she felt particularly Cold and was looking for warmth. She didn’t know why she felt drawn to him, because White Tiger didn’t speak much. Or maybe it was because she didn’t understand his language. And unlike her, White Tiger strived in the Cold.

And little by little she would start to understand what White Tiger was telling her. Sometime he would speak to the Viking Princess of Passion and sometimes of Power, he would talk to her of physical and emotional Healing and of the gift of Foresight.\n\nThe Viking Princess was more than intrigued. She held on to every bit of information her mystical friend would give her. But at one point she realized, everything she understood and took in from White Tiger, her body didn’t know how to deal with. And little by little, making it’s way up from her toes, her body started to freeze.\n\nShe went into a panic an\n\nd begged White Tiger to heal her. But the more White Tiger spoke to her, the worse it got. Her legs were transforming into huge blocs of Ice and every step she took sent shocks of pain through her entire body. She could barely walk anymore and she started to curse her body and the weather like she had never cursed in her life.\n\nBut, like I said she was pretty damn headstrong and she never blamed White Tiger. She stayed with him for a long time, trying to live with a Frozen pair of legs. And White Tiger never blamed her for not understanding what he was saying. He still tried the best he could, but that Viking Princess had a head as thick as a rock.\n\nSo White Tiger went to ask the help of his friend Sea Turtle. He thought that if Sea Turtle could teach the Viking Princess how to use the Earth’s limitless energies rather than her own to accomplish her will, she would finally heal. But when the Viking Princess saw Sea Turtle, an entirely different idea came to her mind. She asked Sea Turtle to take her legs away, said that she had always wanted to live and explore the Sea just like her and wanted a tail so she could swim and go where no one in her family has ever been before.\n\nSea Turtle, who is Mother Earth itself, granted her that wish. She said she could give the Viking Princess a long and sleek tail that would make her glide as fast as Swordfish could. But there was one small trick to it. Sea Turtle gave the Viking Princess one year to live under the Sea. At the end of the year she had to come back to the surface of the Earth and only then would she have to decide whether she would live forever with a pair of legs or a fish tail.\n\nThe Viking Princess more than happily agreed, especially since she knew she would choose the tail and not her horrible uncontrollable and painful legs. And so Sea Turtle lead the Viking Princess into the Ocean, and as the waves took her in, slowly the ice in her legs melted, her skin turned to scales and she, she, changed into a Mermaid.\n\n1 thought on “The Viking, the White Tiger and the Mermaid.

Other than last year when I was in Detroit conducting one of the 50 sing-alongs for “The D” in a laundromat with people spinning around in dryers singing the official unofficial theme song I cowrote for Detroit.\n\nAs luck would have it THIS year was a particularly special September 21st as just a couple days earlier NPR did a story on why “September”, my very first hit cowritten with Maurice White and Al McKay, remains such a timeless song, symbolizing warmth, love, and soul. This year, September 21 was even more special because I decided to perform in Detroit for the very first time ever. So my cowriter and partner on the music portion of the project Andrae Alexander and I put together a 15 piece band made up of the very best musicians and singers we found during the 50 sing-alongs last year to perform live with us in BaDeYa, Detroit!. We also wanted to give everyone a preview of the song which finally has a preliminary mix after over a solid year of trying to deal with 5000 vocal and instrument tracks, each one with up to hundreds of voices on them. There’s just so much room in the sound spectrum and every inch of it we have taken up truly sounds like something you have never heard before.\n\nFor an artist such as myself who dotes on every detail of a stage production from designing the invitations, handmaking the set, picking theme food, designing the merchandise, casting people who help us like I’m casting characters in a musical, shipping 20 crates of everything to Detroit, directing, coproducing, and doing just about everything else involved in a production – albeit all with fantastic collaborators – this was no easy feat. And performing out of town for essentially the first time in my adult life makes that even harder. But don’t even ask me how worth it it was!!! Easily one of the best days/nights of my life!\n\nWe performed at United Sound, a still-in-existence historic recording studio in Detroit where everyone from Charlie Parker to The Rolling Stones and some of my all-time favorite records like Isaac Hayes’ “Shaft”, The Dramatics’ “Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get”, and Marvin Gaye’s “What’s Goin’ On” were recorded. But to turn a brilliant recording studio into a brilliant performance space is another issue entirely, especially when it involves things like sets, choreographed videographers who leap over drums on crash cymbal cues and organ sweeps, and all the other madness that goes into an Allee Willis production.\n\nAs 99% of this now 2 1/2 year Detroit gargantuan mofo project “The D”, the song and record, and Allee Willis Willis Loves Detroit, the feature-length film about human spirit as seen through the people of Detroit and how my life parallels that struggle, has been funded by me, this meant getting people involved in BaDeYa, Detroit! working for gratis. Which they thankfully, gratefully, and miraculously did. From the band to just about everyone else who worked in any capacity on the show, They are saints. They are insanely talented. They are blissfully soulful, and primary examples of why I feel so compelled to make a film about the people of Detroit and how it is THEY who will rebuild the city because of their resilient spirit.\n\nI want to give a special shout out to Malcolm Harris and Donnevan Tolbert, two young gentleman I saw play Mister and Harpo when their high school, Cass Tech, became the first in the country to license the musical I co-wrote, The Color Purple, a couple years ago, and who did a brilliant spoken word intro to my show. And I want to thank the five brilliant dancers from The Mosaic Youth Theater of Detroit who donned mechanics uniforms and spun car tires over their heads during the sneak peak world premiere of the first mix of “The D” and boogied their butts off during “Boogie Wonderland”. I want to also thank the stupendous audience not only for showing up as songwriters remain the buried treasure of the music industry but also for participating so wildly so that the show came off just as I had prayed it would. Like a party in my living room. And if you don’t know my reputation for throwing parties better go here now.\n\nAs a result of having so much fun, hitting a new plateau in my budding performing career, I love Detroit even more than I have kvelled about it before, as if that was even possible. And I will eternally love the 21st of September for doing everything from giving me a second birthday because I hear from thousands of people that day telling me how happy the song makes them feel. This year it made me the happiest of all.\n\nI hope you can see the spirit that was jumping off of the stage and ricocheting back to us in these photos.

My career in the Mushroom Gang might illuminate the dread that is upon us.\n\nI entered graduate school in 1993, the last moment to believe “The Bowen Report,” which predicted a shortage of humanists and a surplus of faculty positions in the 1990s. As Leonard Cassuto argues, it was catastrophically mistaken: “the book became notorious for its Panglossian forecast of better times for academic job seekers. It soon symbolized the misguided optimism of a generation of would-be professors who kept waiting for their ship to come in, and eventually starved by the shore.” I was lucky to find a full-time position in 2003, and then to change positions in 2007, just before the financial crisis. I landed a rolling-contract job with rank but no tenure—typical for instructors at conservatories and design schools. Most importantly, I did not land in an English department. I would become undisciplined among others. We are historians, poets, political theorists, art historians, philosophers, linguists, and even literature-types, all clinging to a school with other purposes. Everything we teach—composition, core courses, and electives—is part of a curriculum for performing artists. They require credits outside the major to attain a bachelor’s degree. A technicality, really. Our marginality makes us precarious, and thus, full of dread. But we are a multitude. We spring up all over the place. We are mushrooms at the end of a world that envisioned humanists as prodigies of culture. Sempervirens semper fi. No more.\n\nAbove is the stump of a Norway maple growing fungi on a curb in Highland Park, New Jersey. This is me: adventitious, peripheral. Not-tree, I never became the kind of scholar who taught me. I don’t cultivate majors. I don’t teach electives to undergrads who love literature. I have no graduate students. Working in “Liberal Arts,” an undiscipline, I learned to attach myself to heartwood: reading carefully, writing reflectively, responding in community. From these commitments, my department explores ways of knowing and political awareness. We address students as beginning world-citizens. It isn’t a liberation into a stream of consciousness led by the professor’s research, but there’s a lot of action in the Stump. These days, clearing a space for student self-examination and the discovery of an interconnected world is hardly trivial. Even now, my department is moving from a defunct version of the Columbia Core Curriculum, a study of absolute texts, to a question-centered core that opens into the crises of the twenty-first century. In other words, we adapted in order to survive. But as Anna Tsing asks, what does survival mean?\n\nThe Stump is everywhere now. As I write this, the Kansas Board of Regents has voted to suspend tenure for two years and vitiate structures of shared governance throughout the state university system. The CUNY schools remain chronically underfunded. Small liberal arts colleges like Sweetbriar and Green Mountain College teeter on the edge and fall. Marquette University is slashing its non-tenured liberal arts faculty. Examples abound, but the take-home is: we are always in danger. What lessons can be gleaned in dangerous times from my undisciplined life?\n\nThis is still the edge of dread. But dread can rid us of illusions that retard the work. For example: It has been difficult to admit that institutions have no honor. The local Stump considers me a factotum. The structures that govern our employment are transactional, not ethical: we are a means to an end, and we can be replaced at the will of administrators. That doesn’t mean we have to act as if we are replaceable. Undisciplined labor thereby takes on an intellectual, rhetorical, and political cast.\n\nWe must develop a theory of our fungal powers and deploy them as mycelial praxis. The visible mushroom, after all, is the fruiting body of a larger creature strategically invisible from above. By recognizing undisciplinarity, we understand ourselves not as the old university, a besieged forest, but the mycelia that network the ground for a post-Stump ecology. Not exactly rhizomatic, but not powerless, either. It’s hard to let go of the structures that formed us, but a prefigurative pedagogy requires it. As universities and forests fall into capitalist ruin, we must become the other world that is growing in the dark.\n\nAnthony Lioi is Professor of English at the Juilliard School in New York City, where he teaches composition, American literature, and environmental humanities.

All good things come to an end, and so it looks as though today is the last of the warm days for a while, with the daytime temperature dropping from the low 20’s to just 9 degrees tomorrow and Tuesday, accompanied by some cool nights too. There is very little rain in the forecast, so I have been dragging the sprinkler around to water the recently planted onions, leeks, lettuces and cabbages. I sowed carrots and turnips last week, so they are getting a drink too, otherwise germination will be very patchy. Actually as I write this the weather has broken, there is thunder and lightning and a little rain, just enough to wet the ground; every little helps.\n\nFortunately I managed to cut the grass in the orchard this afternoon while it was still dry, the apple trees are looking good, with lots of them coming into bloom; I do hope that we don’t get frosts so severe that the blossom is damaged. Last year was a disaster, I am hoping for a bumper crop this summer, for fresh fruit and for juice.\n\nI hope that you lot like lettuces, because I’ve now planted hundreds of them; this morning I set out another batch of 160, to follow on from 2 previous plantings of a similar size. I normally sell a lot of lettuces at the farmers’ market, but as I am steering clear of it at the moment I am relying on you to go salad crazy.

Blackthorn, flowering cherries, hawthorn, primroses, cowslips, celandines, speedwell, these and many more contribute to visual delights everywhere you look. The backdrop to this Technicolor set is the fresh new soft foliage in every shade of green that clothes the trees and bushes in the landscape. There have been butterflies aplenty in the past week, I have seen Peacock, Brimstone, Small Tortoiseshell, Orange Tip, Red Admiral, Comma and Small White; but not yet a Holly Blue. Up on the top pond there are tiny clockwork ducklings randomly skittering this way and that on the surface of the water, and Canada Geese honking their heads off for no apparent reason. At home I saw my first Swallow of the season yesterday, sharing the airspace behind our cottage with the Skylarks. I am always conscious of the flora and fauna that surrounds me, but this year it is as if my senses are heightened, helped by the reduction of manmade noise – less traffic on the roads, virtually no traffic in the sky. The next thing to tick off on my seasonal list is the call of the Cuckoo; perhaps the pandemic will mean that there are fewer hunters abroad to prevent them from returning on their epic journey. Oh, and since setting my trap the rabbit has been conspicuous by its absence.\n\nStumpy the scruffy white pony is a little less scruffy and a little whiter this week. He had a shower! Tabitha the stud groom’s girlfriend decided that he needed smartening up, so she took the hose to him. He was very good during his pampering session, mainly because I fed him carrots to keep him quiet. His coat felt so much nicer afterwards, and he even had his mane plaited, which I think he saw as being undignified for a testosterone fuelled stud pony.\n\nIt’s the last hurrah for several items in the ‘shop’. I have only a very few leeks, very few radishes, very few Pak Choi, and limited spinach. After this week it really is going to be back to basics for a while. Apologies for the potatoes last week, I ordered the wrong ones, and discovered that whilst perfectly sound, those I received were pretty small, so I sympathise with whoever has to peel them in your house. I should have the correct type this week, along with bakers and Pink Fir Apple. Basically the selection in the shop is the same as last week, albeit with limited availability of various items. I have ordered a larger quantity of oranges this week, so hopefully there will be enough for all.\n\nI had an unexpected hold-up while I was delivering last Friday. I drop off some boxes at customers that live in one of the small side streets that run at 90 degrees to Long Melford high street. The road is quite narrow, only one vehicle width on account of cars being parked along it’s whole length. Anyway, as I pulled into the street I found myself following a middle aged man wearing a full length cassock dragging a huge cross behind him, with an elderly woman a few metres in his wake carrying a carrier bag and wearing sandwich boards informing onlookers that Jesus died on the cross to save us. I wonder if she had loaves and fishes in her bag? In previous years I have passed the pilgrims carrying the cross to Walsingham, but they do it mob handed and appear to be having fun; chummy in Melford was probably wearing a hair shirt under his robe just to lessen the fun factor. I’m not ridiculing him, I love the fact that there are individuals like him with such conviction. In the whole scheme of things it cost me about 5 minutes of my time as I headed the cavalcade behind him, and I was pleased to have happened upon the scene. I have no religious faith, but well done that man.\n\nI am sorry if some of you sometimes don’t receive everything in your box that you had ordered, I’m afraid that it’s just human error on my part. I am packing around 700 items per week in the boxes at present, so inevitably the odd error is going to occur; it’s a consequence of working under pressure I’m afraid. Please let me know when you are short of anything and I will make amends.\n\nJust a reminder that I am continuing to minimise contact, so in most cases boxes will be left on doorsteps. On Thursday Jennifer has been dropping off most of the local orders; don’t engage with her! She is under strict instructions to drop the boxes and run, but she is somewhat more gregarious than I am and is much more likely to stop for a chat given the opportunity, please don’t tempt her. The other thing to remind you is that the order deadline is Tuesday night. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nEnjoy your Easter egg….go for a jog in the morning as penance."}]}, {"type": "interleaved", "items": [{"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00264.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "I’ve been collecting images of women’s blouses from 1917; this particular page shows such a variety of skirts, blouses and hats that it deserves a closer look."}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00265.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "This blouse was also featured in a color illustration in June:"}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00266.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "And in a different version in August:"}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00267.jpg"}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00268.jpg"}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00269.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "Butterick 9203 was shown with a relatively simple stitched-down pleat skirt (No. 9276) , but the skirt was enhanced with a checked cotton belt and matching checked border:"}, {"type": "image", "path": "output_dataset/images/00270.jpg"}, {"type": "text", "content": "Blouse 9203 could be made with a high-necked insert; the blouse has a sailor collar in back.

Symbolism is the literary practice of using objects, people or situations to represent ideas that are greater than the objects' literal meanings. Iconicity refers to the visual relationship of a symbol to its referent and varies along a continuum from transparent to opaque.
