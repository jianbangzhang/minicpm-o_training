There's no info yet about whether VW intends to accept the offer or further negotiate the deal.\n\nQuantum Group is a holding company based in Zurich, Switzerland, and it might have a tangential relationship with the Porsche family.Rea Stark is representing Quantum in the Lamborghini purchase offer. He is also a co-founder of PiëchAutomotive along with Anton Piëch who is the son of former VW Group boss Ferdinand Piëch and the great-grandson of Ferdinand Porsche. Although, it's not clear if Anton Piëch has any role in this attempt to buy Lamborghini, according to Autocar.\n\nQuantum Group wants to purchase more than just the Lamborghini name. The deal would include buying the entire facility inSant’Agata, Italy, and the firm's motorsport operations. There would also be a five-year supplier agreement with Audi, which likely would allow Lambo to continue to produce the current models while preparing new ones. Quantum wants to shape the brand to \"spearhead for innovation by consistently implementing new clean drivetrain technologies,\" according to a document obtained by Autocar.\n\nThere have been rumors for years about VW Group selling Lamborghini. However, in late 2020, the automaker's supervisory board voted not to sell Lambo, Bentley, and Ducati. The company was doing an internal examination to see if the resources were available to develop EVs and autonomous technology while also investing in these premium marques.\"Brands must be measured against new requirements,\" VW Group Chief Executive Herbert Diess said at the time."

        "content": "The agriculture sector as the main source of income for the most countries of the world in economic activities is very important. The sector due to its high contribution in GNP and export incomes play the critical role in directing and positioning the economic development process especially in third world countries. The agriculture development cannot be fulfilled only by injection of capital and technology to agriculture sector but this is a multidimensional process that many factors intervene on it. The optimization and reinforcement of human resource in agriculture development is undeniable. A kind of investment that today is unavoidable for public and private sector from the expert point of views is to reinforce and develop the entrepreneurship in agriculture sector [6]. Nowadays the agriculture is considered as a sector for complementing the economy and entrepreneurship activities as response to recession and problems in agriculture sector and survival strategy for rural family. One of the suitable options toward competition and commercializing the agriculture sector and active involvement in global markets is to develop the trade units for greenhouse usage [3]. The greenhouse town is a set of greenhouses that is focused in a common space, this is an incorporated and coordinated cultivation and for avoidance from breaking apart the lands and lead to reduction of production costs, enhancement of production productivity, and as a result increasing the farmers income. The greenhouse town of Hashtgerd is the first and biggest hydroponic greenhouse town of Iran by an area amounted 170 hectares that after completing, 1300 skilled and non-skilled person will be employed there. Raman et al. (2008) in a researched titled motivational factors influencing on entrepreneurship decision making believes that the motivation and environmental conditions play the important role in entrepreneurship [8]. Hindle (2006) in his research considered the job satisfaction and age as the most important variables influencing on entrepreneurship [4]. Royer (2003) considered the job satisfaction and age as the most important variable influencing on entrepreneurship too [9]. Lashgarara et al. (2011) concluded that there is a positive relationship between education in high levels and entrepreneurship activities development [5]. Farajolah Hosseini and Mcelwee (2011) in their research found that 67 percent of variance of rural women about the influencing factors on entrepreneurship activates are explained by education, motivation, economic factors and psychological factors [2]. In a research that has been done by Ghonchi et al (2010) the economical, technical and technology individual, professional and infrastructure has been considered as the most important avoiding factors for development of greenhouse units [3]. Sharifi et al (2009) in their paper express that the attitude of the most greenhouse holders toward development and spread of greenhouse is in intermediate and good level and on the other hand there is a positive and significant relationship between communicative channels, performance level, technical knowledge level, net income, green house background, education [10]. Morad nejadi et al (2007) concluded that the economic environment is the most important factor for entrepreneurship in Iran and after them the entrepreneur’s psychological attributes, marketing skills and access to resources, environmental dynamic, and interest toward agriculture are known as other main factors [6]. The town has high problems including inefficiency of major infrastructure like water, electricity and gas, bank lending problems, lack of education, input financing problems like fuel, water price calculation based on industry and not agriculture and some other problems that preclude suitable using from town advantages. Therefore perhaps we can claim that the town could not achieve to one the most important aim toward creating jobs for unemployed graduates of agriculture. Due to cited items the greenhouse cultivation is considered as a novel phenomenon that has not been in Iran for a long time. Despite quantitative growth of greenhouse units in the country, this productive units deal with some multiple problems that make their qualitative development difficult. The current research is aimed to explore the influencing factors on entrepreneurship development of Hashtgerd greenhouse town in order to provide some approaches for entrepreneurship development in this town. The current research is done for Hastgerd greenhouse town located in Savejbolagh in Alborz province. The duration of research is 2011 -2012.\n\nThis is applied study; from the data collection is the descriptive and based on method is correlation. The statistical population in this research includes 39 users of greenhouse town of Hashtgerd. Due to smallness of statistical population and less numbers of users the census method has been used. The instrument used in this study to gather data was the questionnaire. Due to the nature and objectives of this research study is to evaluate the content validity of the questionnaire, to measure the validity questionnaire, the number of Islamic Azad University professors and experts were conducted to examine the necessary and the collection of comments reform of the questionnaire was obtained. In order to determine the reliability of the data collected through questionnaires, Cronbach's alpha test was used for overall Cronbach's alpha of the questionnaire was between 0.914 to 0.972. Independent variables included psychological, economic, and technical support- social- cultural, educational and policy. The dependent variable in this research is the development of entrepreneurial farmers in Hashtgerd Town greenhouse. In order to measure the dependent variable in the form of a Likert questionnaire item 5 is used. In this study, data were collected in two ways: a library research and field studies. After collecting and sorting data, the analysis the data in two stages, using descriptive statistics and inferential statistics were taken. All data processing and statistical analysis was performed using the software SPSS18.\n\nConsidering the results obtained in this study, the average age is 31.89 years. Most beneficiaries that is 38.5 percent have a bachelor's degree. Average exploiters of record service have 6.74 years. 43.6% of farmers produce strawberries product that has accounted for the highest percentage. In order to evaluate the development of entrepreneurship in the town of greenhouse Hashtgerd the form of a five-item Likert 5 option is used. The findings of the study indicate that the majority of the subjects (41 percent) believe entrepreneurship development in the Town of greenhouse Hashtgerd is too much (Table 1). Table 1.

I immediately recieved a call to an address I knew to be in the Elyton project.\n\nThe cell phone seemed to be a permanant attachment to her body. She didn’t take it down from her ear until we had reached our destination. She was young, I’d say about 20. She was thin and dressed cheaply, a red bandana covered her hair. She quickly told me where she wanted to go, a payday/title loan place on Greensprings Highway. She was talking with someone who was obviously selling her something. I overheard talk of shipping options, dates of arrival ect…Whatever it was, I guess she really wanted it. So much so that she would call a cab to take her to get a loan to buy a money order in order to buy it, whatever it was.\n\nShe didn’t stay in the place very long, she was turned down quickly. It seems the only payday she had was a government check for a little more than two hundred dollars a month. She had no car to pawn the title to, she was S.O.L and so was I. She already owed me more than $20 by this time. Once it became clear that she had no means of paying the fare I just turned the meter off and told her I would take her home but let her know in no uncertain terms that I didn’t have to. I could have, and probably should have, just left her ass stranded there.\n\nI gave her a lecture on the way home about why she should make sure she had money before she called a cab. I told her that I could have called the cops and that most drivers would have called them. “Fo’ real?” she asked. “Fo’ what?” She had no idea that stiffing a cab driver could possibly be against the law. I told her it was called theft of service, which is similar to theft of property, like shoplifting from a store.”Naw it ain’t” she said. It seemed to me that this young woman had grown to adulthood without a clue as to how to function in society. Pitiful, I thought. At least she did offer a “thank you” as she got out of the car back at home.\n\nIt was fairly early in the morning, after sunrise but before 8am. I had been working the going to work business in the 400 and 500 zones. It had been raining off and on and was a very gray morning. Norwood is one of Birmingham’s grand old neighborhoods that fell into decline and disrepair after the white flight. Big houses that were once elegant mansions line some of the streets. A few of them, a very few, have been bought in recent years and renovated back to their former glory. Most are still in sad shape, some repairable with a major effort. Others that are burned out or literally falling down are beyond repair. This call wasn’t to an old mansion but to a decent home in good shape."

A young girl, no doubt a teenager, jumped up and immediately got in the back seat. “How much will it cost to take me to Bessemer?” she asked. i said probably about $40, maybe more, depending on where it is in Bessemer. At first I didn’t worry about getting stiffed because most passengers that intend to stiff you don’t ask for an estimate. That’s because they’re not planning on paying you anyway.\n\nOn the way to Bessemer I learned that she was 16 and she had been out all night with boys that her mother didn’t like. She anticipated a big fight with her mother when she got home and was clearly anxious about it. She didn’t tell me but I instinctively knew that my fare would depend on an angry, possibly hysterical mother paying me. I started to worry. When we arrived at the house the meter was at $42 and mom was nowhere to be found. My customer’s brother said that he thought she had been called to work but he wasn’t sure. The girl made no attempt to call her mom. Maybe she couldn’t take calls at work or maybe it was just out of fear, I don’t know.\n\nThe girl was about to panic. “I don’t know how I’m going to pay you” she said. I had just been stiffed by the payday loan girl about a week earlier and I wasn’t in the mood to get stiffed again. I had already decided that I would call the cops if it became necessary. She approached the car window and said “I’ve got this little bracelet, it’s made of silver and gold. If I can pawn it I’ll pay you.” She saw that the meter was at $42 already and was able to reason that by the time she got to the pawn shop and took the necessary time to pawn it, the fare would be much higher. She asked if I could just charge her a flat rate. I told her that if she didn’t mess around and take too much of my time I would turn the meter off and just charge her the $42, she agreed.\n\nThe first place turned her down cold. The second place had a sign out front that said “We Buy Gold”. She stayed in this place for about ten minutes. She came out accompanied by a bling wearing heavyweight dude that reminded me of Biggie Smalls. The rain had started to fall steadily as the big guy knocked on my window. He had a $100 bill in his hand. He asked “you got fifty eight dollars?” I dug around in my pockets and found that I did indeed have fifty eight dollars. Just as we made the transaction my customer said “you don’t have to worry about taking me back home.” She and Biggie walked back into the office. I got paid and I don’t know how the story ended with her mom."

Indeed, instead of \"problem\", \"difficulty\", \"complaint\", \"enquiry\" and so on, everything in the world of business, government and so many organisations of all colours these days, is an \"issue\". In particular when it comes to contacting a company to make a complaint there is a subtle psychology at work here when instead of admitting incompetence, shortcomings, inefficiency etc., it's all referred to as being \"an issue\": the reason for this is that the use of the word \"issue\" in this context is an attempt to neutralise any potential admission of guilt or wrong doing; e.g. I contacted my internet service provider once to complain about the slowness of their rectifying a fault and was told \"we have looked into your account and have not found any issues there\".

        "content": "You could say our team here at Heavenly Tea Leaves has a thing for Japanese culture, and of course, Japanese tea. Japan is a country that is revered for its ancient history, rich traditions, and pride in quality and care for every product they grow or create. Because among our team members we've visited Japan a number of times, we've developed a special interest in all types of teas from this Pacific nation--and we don't just mean matcha!\n\nOriginally sought after as medicine, tea was first brought to Japan by Chinese monks in the 8th century and was first consumed by the upper class (Samurai) and priests in Japan. The archipelago proved to have the right climate and terrain for growing tea; to this day, tea is cultivated in almost all regions of the country. Access to tea by the greater public did not come around until the Middle Ages. Influenced by Zen Buddhism, the Japanese tea ceremony (known as chanoyu or chado) developed as a unique practice with its own specialty teas and clean esthetics.\n\nJapan focuses mostly on green tea, which serves the benefit of lively and deep flavor, a plethora of healthy properties, and a steady stream of energy. Not all Japanese green teas are made the same, however. Here, we will take a closer look at the various tea types, both popular and rare, that you'll need to add to your South Pacific tea repertoire!\n\nWe always love to start off with a bang; in this case, that bang is a cup of rejuvenating Gyokuro green tea. Gyokuro is a green tea for those looking for umami flavor (perfect for the AM hours). Thanks to a unique processing method at the final stages of this tea plant's growth, it is shaded, leading to a higher chlorophyll content than the typical green tea, as well as a deep, rich green color and grassy, vegetal flavor.\n\nFor a nuttier variation, try Genmaicha Japan. Also a green tea, this one is known as the \"people's tea\" in Japan because it was economical to include toasted rice in the home blend; this tea doubles down on your umami senses thanks to the presence of popcorn and fire-roasted rice alongside a classic, rich green tea. The result? A party in your mouth that won't be ending any time soon.\n\nSometimes, though, we like to climb the green tea ladder. One of the more lavish Japanese tea experiences you can have is with our Kukicha. What makes this one special is that it contains stems and stalks left over from sencha and matcha tea production, so it utilizes the entire plant. Once considered peasant's tea, this variety is now known as a delicacy in Japan because of its natural sweetness and laundry list of health benefits.\n\nLooking for yet another Japanese green? Our well-rounded Zen Super Green is the answer for those looking for the consistency of regular tea but the potency of matcha (which in turn is made from first-flush spring Gyokuro). This blend of organic sencha and matcha green tea powder is the perfect balance between strong and delicate and finishes with a velvety, umami, vegetal mouthfeel. Be careful not to brew this and other delicate green teas at higher than 170 degrees, as you may burn the tea and extract unwanted bitterness!\n\nAs you may know, we're total matcha lovers. In fact, we've written an ode to matcha already--check it out! Matcha is a fine green tea powder that's super-concentrated in flavor, texture, and health benefits. It's made by simply whisking the powder into boiling water (and perhaps adding frothed milk and sugar if you're going for a matcha latte!). Our ceremonial-grade 30-gram matcha tin contains hand-picked and stone-ground green tea and come ready to brew.\n\nHojicha, which has a distinct roasted taste, is another signature Japanese blend carried by Heavenly Tea Leaves. So, what's the conclusion? Japan is definitely a tea destination worth learning about (and visiting), and its green teas are quite varied and totally spectacular. Japan's rich and detail-oriented culture shines brightly through their ability to manufacture some of the world's most premium green teas. Which one will you get your hands on this spring?\n\nP.S. Stay tuned to our Instagram page (@heavenlytea) for some photos of our latest trip to the majestic tea fields of Wazuka, Japan!"

(Yonhap)\nThe top diplomats of South Korea, the United States and Japan will hold trilateral talks on the margins of a Group of Seven (G-7) gathering in London later this week, a source said Tuesday, as Washington eyes a thaw in strained ties between its Asian allies.\n\nThe meeting between Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong, and his US and Japanese counterparts, Antony Blinken and Toshimitsu Motegi, respectively, is set to take place Wednesday, as they gathered in the British capital for the session of G-7 foreign and development ministers.\n\nThe meeting will mark the first direct engagement between Chung and Motegi, as Chung's overtures for dialogue with the Japanese minister had fallen on deaf ears amid tensions over Tokyo's wartime forced labor, sexual slavery and export curbs.\n\nOn Monday, Chung said he may also meet with Motegi bilaterally after the trilateral meeting, but it still remains uncertain if their talks will take place.\n\nThe three-way meeting has been arranged amid concerns that prolonged spats between South Korea and Japan would undercut America's efforts to revitalize its regional democratic alliance network in the face of China's growing assertiveness and North Korea's nuclear threats.\n\nRelations between Seoul and Tokyo have shown no signs of improvement due to historical spats stemming from Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula, as well as its recent decision to discharge radioactive water from its crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant.\n\nAt their talks, Chung, Blinken and Motegi are expected to discuss a coordinated strategy on North Korea.\n\nLast week, the White House said that the Joe Biden administration had completed its review of policy toward Pyongyang, and that it will seek a \"calibrated, practical\" approach toward the goal of the complete denuclearization of the peninsula.\n\nThe three sides could also discuss pending global issues, such as the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, distribution of vaccines and climate change.\n\nSouth Korea, the US and Japan held their last trilateral foreign ministerial meeting on the sidelines of an international security forum in Germany in February last year.\n\nThough not party to the G-7 grouping, South Korea, Australia, India, South Africa and Brunei, the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, have been invited to the forum as guests.
